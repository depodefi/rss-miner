      <title>Into the Omniverse: OpenUSD and NVIDIA Halos Accelerate Safety for Robotaxis, Physical AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/openusd-halos-safety-robotaxi-physical-ai/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Editor’s note: This post is part of Into the Omniverse , a series focused on how developers, 3D practitioners and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advancements in OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse . Physical AI is moving from research labs into the real world, powering intelligent robots and autonomous vehicles (AVs) — such as robotaxis — that must reliably sense, reason and act amid unpredictable conditions. To safely scale these systems, developers need workflows that connect real-world data, high-fidelity simulation and robust AI models atop the common foundation provided by the OpenUSD framework. The recently published OpenUSD Core Specification 1.0 , OpenUSD — aka Universal Scene Description — now defines standard data types, file formats and composition behaviors, giving developers predictable, interoperable USD pipelines as they scale autonomous systems. Powered by OpenUSD, NVIDIA Omniverse libraries combine NVIDIA RTX rendering, physics simulation and efficient runtimes to create digital twins and simulation-ready ( SimReady ) assets that accurately reflect real-world environments for synthetic data generation and testing. NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models can run on top of these simulations to amplify data variation, generating new weather, lighting and terrain conditions from the same scenes so teams can safely cover rare and challenging edge cases. Learn more by watching the OpenUSD livestream today at 11 a.m. PT or in replay, part of the NVIDIA Omniverse OpenUSD Insiders series: In addition, advancements in synthetic data generation , multimodal datasets and SimReady workflows are now converging with the NVIDIA Halos framework for AV safety, creating a standards-based path to safer, faster, more cost-effective deployment of next-generation autonomous machines. Building the Foundation for Safe Physical AI Open Standards and SimReady Assets The OpenUSD Core Specification 1.0 establishes the standard data models and behaviors that underpin SimReady assets, enabling developers to build interoperable simulation pipelines for AI factories and robotics on OpenUSD . Built on this foundation, SimReady 3D assets can be reused across tools and teams and loaded directly into NVIDIA Isaac Sim , where USDPhysics colliders, rigid body dynamics and composition-arc–based variants let teams test robots in virtual facilities that closely mirror real operations. Open-Source Learning The Learn OpenUSD curriculum is now open source and available on GitHub, enabling contributors to localize and adapt templates, exercises and content for different audiences, languages and use cases. This gives educators a ready-made foundation to onboard new teams into OpenUSD-centric simulation workflows.​ Generative Worlds as Safety Multiplier Gaussian splatting — a technique that uses editable 3D elements to render environments quickly and with high fidelity — and world models are accelerating simulation pipelines for safe robotics testing and validation. At SIGGRAPH Asia, the NVIDIA Research team introduced Play4D , a streaming pipeline that enables 4D Gaussian splatting to accurately render dynamic scenes and improve realism. Spatial intelligence company World Labs is using its Marble generative world model with NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Omniverse NuRec so researchers can turn text prompts and sample images into photorealistic, Gaussian-based physics-ready 3D environments in hours instead of weeks. Those worlds can then be used for physical AI training, testing and sim-to-real transfer. This high-fidelity simulation workflow expands the range of scenarios robots can practice in while keeping experimentation safely in simulation. Lightwheel Helps Teams Scale Robot Training With SimReady Assets Powered by OpenUSD, Lightwheel ’s SimReady asset library includes a common scene description layer, making it easy to assemble high-fidelity digital twins for robots. The SimReady assets are embedded with precise geometry, materials and validated physical properties, which can be loaded directly into NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab for robot training. This allows robots to experience realistic contacts, dynamics and sensor feedback as they learn. End-to-End Autonomous Vehicle Safety End-to-end autonomous vehicle safety advancements are accelerating with new research, open frameworks and inspection services that make validation more rigorous and scalable. NVIDIA researchers, with collaborators at Harvard University and Stanford University, recently introduced the Sim2Val framework to statistically combine real-world and simulated test results, reducing AV developers’ need for costly physical mileage while demonstrating how robotaxis and AVs can behave safely across rare and safety-critical scenarios. Learn more by watching NVIDIA’s “Safety in the Loop” livestream: These innovations are complemented by a new, open-source NVIDIA Omniverse NuRec Fixer, a Cosmos-based model trained on AV data that removes artifacts in neural reconstructions to produce higher-quality SimReady assets. To align these advances with rigorous global standards, the NVIDIA Halos AI Systems Inspection Lab — accredited by ANAB — provides impartial inspection and certification of Halos elements across robotaxi fleets, AV stacks, sensors and manufacturer platforms through the Halos Certification Program . AV Ecosystem Leaders Putting Physical AI Safety to Work Bosch , Nuro and Wayve are among the first participants in the NVIDIA Halos AI Systems Inspection Lab, which aims to accelerate the safe, large-scale deployment of robotaxi fleets. Onsemi, which makes sensor systems for AVs, industrial automation and medical applications, has recently become the first company to pass inspection for the NVIDIA Halos AI Systems Inspection Lab. The open-source CARLA simulator integrates NVIDIA NuRec and Cosmos Transfer to generate reconstructed drives and diverse scenario variations, while Voxel51 ’s FiftyOne engine, linked to Cosmos Dataset Search, NuRec and Cosmos Transfer, helps teams curate, annotate and evaluate multimodal datasets across the AV pipeline.​ Mcity at the University of Michigan is enhancing the digital twin of its 32-acre AV test facility using Omniverse libraries and technologies. The team is integrating the NVIDIA Blueprint for AV simulation and Omniverse Sensor RTX application programming interfaces to create physics-based models of camera, lidar, radar and ultrasonic sensors. By aligning real sensor recordings with high-fidelity simulated data and sharing assets openly, Mcity enables safe, repeatable testing of rare and hazardous driving scenarios before vehicles operate on public roads.

      <title>UC San Diego Lab Advances Generative AI Research With NVIDIA DGX B200 System</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ucsd-generative-ai-research-dgx-b200/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The Hao AI Lab research team at the University of California San Diego — at the forefront of pioneering AI model innovation — recently received an NVIDIA DGX B200 system to elevate their critical work in large language model inference . Many LLM inference platforms in production today, such as NVIDIA Dynamo , use research concepts that originated in the Hao AI Lab, including DistServe . How Is Hao AI Lab Using the DGX B200? Members of the Hao AI Lab standing with the NVIDIA DGX B200 system. With the DGX B200 now fully accessible to the Hao AI Lab and broader UC San Diego community at the School of Computing, Information and Data Sciences’ San Diego Supercomputer Center , the research opportunities are boundless. “DGX B200 is one of the most powerful AI systems from NVIDIA to date, which means that its performance is among the best in the world,” said Hao Zhang, assistant professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and department of computer science and engineering at UC San Diego. “It enables us to prototype and experiment much faster than using previous-generation hardware.” Two Hao AI Lab projects the DGX B200 is accelerating are FastVideo and the Lmgame benchmark. FastVideo focuses on training a family of video generation models to produce a five-second video based on a given text prompt — in just five seconds. The research phase of FastVideo taps into NVIDIA H200 GPUs in addition to the DGX B200 system. Lmgame-bench is a benchmarking suite that puts LLMs to the test using popular online games including Tetris and Super Mario Bros . Users can test one model at a time or put two models up against each other to measure their performance. The illustrated workflow of Hao AI Lab’s Lmgame-Bench project. Other ongoing projects at Hao AI Labs explore new ways to achieve low-latency LLM serving, pushing large language models toward real-time responsiveness. “Our current research uses the DGX B200 to explore the next frontier of low-latency LLM-serving on the awesome hardware specs the system gives us,” said Junda Chen, a doctoral candidate in computer science at UC San Diego. How DistServe Influenced Disaggregated Serving Disaggregated inference is a way to ensure large-scale LLM-serving engines can achieve the optimal aggregate system throughput while maintaining acceptably low latency for user requests. The benefit of disaggregated inference lies in optimizing what DistServe calls “goodput” instead of “throughput” in the LLM-serving engine. Here’s the difference: Throughput is measured by the number of tokens per second that the entire system can generate. Higher throughput means lower cost to generate each token to serve the user. For a long time, throughput was the only metric used by LLM-serving engines to measure their performance against one another. While throughput measures the aggregate performance of the system, it doesn’t directly correlate to the latency that a user perceives. If a user demands lower latency to generate the tokens, the system has to sacrifice throughput. This natural trade-off between throughput and latency is what led the DistServe team to propose a new metric, “goodput”: the measure of throughput while satisfying the user-specified latency objectives, usually called service-level objectives. In other words, goodput represents the overall health of a system while satisfying user experience. DistServe shows that goodput is a much better metric for LLM-serving systems, as it factors in both cost and service quality. Goodput leads to optimal efficiency and ideal output from a model. How Can Developers Achieve Optimal Goodput? When a user makes a request in an LLM system, the system takes the user input and generates the first token, known as prefill. Then, the system creates numerous output tokens, one after another, predicting each token’s future behavior based on past requests’ outcomes. This process is known as decode. https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/distserve.mp4 Prefill and decode have historically run on the same GPU, but the researchers behind DistServe found that splitting them onto different GPUs maximizes goodput. “Previously, if you put these two jobs on a GPU, they would compete with each other for resources, which could make it slow from a user perspective,” Chen said. “Now, if I split the jobs onto two different sets of GPUs — one doing prefill, which is compute intensive, and the other doing decode, which is more memory intensive — we can fundamentally eliminate the interference between the two jobs, making both jobs run faster. This process is called prefill/decode disaggregation, or separating the prefill from decode to get greater goodput. Increasing goodput and using the disaggregated inference method enables the continuous scaling of workloads without compromising on low-latency or high-quality model responses. NVIDIA Dynamo — an open-source framework designed to accelerate and scale generative AI models at the highest efficiency levels with the lowest cost — enables scaling disaggregated inference. In addition to these projects, cross-departmental collaborations, such as in healthcare and biology, are underway at UC San Diego to further optimize an array of research projects using the NVIDIA DGX B200, as researchers continue exploring how AI platforms can accelerate innovation.

      <title>How to Fine-Tune an LLM on NVIDIA GPUs With Unsloth</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-fine-tuning-unsloth-dgx-spark/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Modern workflows showcase the endless possibilities of generative and agentic AI on PCs. Of many, some examples include tuning a chatbot to handle product-support questions or building a personal assistant for managing one’s schedule. A challenge remains, however, in getting a small language model to respond consistently with high accuracy for specialized agentic tasks. That’s where fine-tuning comes in. Unsloth , one of the world’s most widely used open-source frameworks for fine-tuning LLMs, provides an approachable way to customize models. It’s optimized for efficient, low-memory training on NVIDIA GPUs — from GeForce RTX desktops and laptops to RTX PRO workstations and DGX Spark , the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. Another powerful starting point for fine-tuning is the just-announced NVIDIA Nemotron 3 family of open models, data and libraries. Nemotron 3 introduces the most efficient family of open models, ideal for agentic AI fine-tuning. Teaching AI New Tricks Fine-tuning is like giving an AI model a focused training session. With examples tied to a specific topic or workflow, the model improves its accuracy by learning new patterns and adapting to the task at hand. Choosing a fine-tuning method for a model depends on how much of the original model the developer wants to adjust. Based on their goals, developers can use one of three main fine-tuning methods: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (such as LoRA or QLoRA) : How it works: Updates only a small portion of the model for faster, lower-cost training. It’s a smarter and efficient way to enhance a model without altering it drastically. Target use case: Useful across nearly all scenarios where full fine-tuning would traditionally be applied — including adding domain knowledge, improving coding accuracy, adapting the model for legal or scientific tasks, refining reasoning, or aligning tone and behavior. Requirements: Small- to medium-sized dataset (100-1,000 prompt-sample pairs). Full fine-tuning : How it works: Updates all of the model’s parameters — useful for teaching the model to follow specific formats or styles. Target use case: Advanced use cases, such as building AI agents and chatbots that must provide assistance about a specific topic, stay within a certain set of guardrails and respond in a particular manner. Requirements: Large dataset (1,000+ prompt-sample pairs). Reinforcement learning : How it works: Adjusts the behavior of the model using feedback or preference signals. The model learns by interacting with its environment and uses the feedback to improve itself over time. This is a complex, advanced technique that interweaves training and inference — and can be used in tandem with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and full fine-tuning techniques. See Unsloth’s Reinforcement Learning Guide for details. Target use case: Improving the accuracy of a model in a particular domain — such as law or medicine — or building autonomous agents that can orchestrate actions on a user’s behalf. Requirements: A process that contains an action model, a reward model and an environment for the model to learn from. Another factor to consider is the VRAM required per each method. The chart below provides an overview of the requirements to run each type of fine-tuning method on Unsloth. Fine-tuning requirements on Unsloth. Unsloth: A Fast Path to Fine-Tuning on NVIDIA GPUs LLM fine-tuning is a memory- and compute-intensive workload that involves billions of matrix multiplications to update model weights at every training step. This type of heavy parallel workload requires the power of NVIDIA GPUs to complete the process quickly and efficiently. Unsloth shines at this workload, translating complex mathematical operations into efficient, custom GPU kernels to accelerate AI training. Unsloth helps boost the performance of the Hugging Face transformers library by 2.5x on NVIDIA GPUs. These GPU-specific optimizations, combined with Unsloth’s ease of use, make fine-tuning accessible to a broader community of AI enthusiasts and developers. The framework is built and optimized for NVIDIA hardware — from GeForce RTX laptops to RTX PRO workstations and DGX Spark — providing peak performance while reducing VRAM consumption. Unsloth provides helpful guides on how to get started and manage different LLM configurations, hyperparameters and options, along with example notebooks and step-by-step workflows. Check out some of these Unsloth guides: Fine-Tuning LLMs With NVIDIA RTX 50 Series GPUs and Unsloth Fine-Tuning LLMs With NVIDIA DGX Spark and Unsloth Learn how to install Unsloth on NVIDIA DGX Spark . Read the NVIDIA technical blog for a deep dive of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. For a hands-on local fine-tuning walkthrough, watch Matthew Berman showing reinforcement learning running on a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 using Unsloth in the video below. Available Now: NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Family of Open Models The new Nemotron 3 family of open models — in Nano, Super, and Ultra sizes — built on a new hybrid latent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, introduces the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy, ideal for building agentic AI applications. Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B, available now, is the most compute-efficient model in the lineup. It’s optimized for tasks such as software debugging, content summarization, AI assistant workflows and information retrieval at low inference costs. Its hybrid MoE design delivers: Up to 60% fewer reasoning tokens, significantly reducing inference cost. A 1 million-token context window, allowing the model to retain far more information for long, multistep tasks. Nemotron 3 Super is a high-accuracy reasoning model for multi-agent applications, while Nemotron 3 Ultra is for complex AI applications. Both are expected to be available in the first half of 2026. NVIDIA also released today an open collection of training datasets and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning libraries. Nemotron 3 Nano fine-tuning is available on Unsloth. Download Nemotron 3 Nano now from Hugging Face , or experiment with it through Llama.cpp and LM Studio. DGX Spark: A Compact AI Powerhouse DGX Spark enables local fine-tuning and brings incredible AI performance in a compact, desktop supercomputer, giving developers access to more memory than a typical PC. Built on the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell architecture, DGX Spark delivers up to a petaflop of FP4 AI performance and includes 128GB of unified CPU-GPU memory, giving developers enough headroom to run larger models, longer context windows and more demanding training workloads locally. For fine-tuning, DGX Spark enables: Larger model sizes. Models with more than 30 billion parameters often exceed the VRAM capacity of consumer GPUs but fit comfortably within DGX Spark’s unified memory. More advanced techniques. Full fine-tuning and reinforcement-learning-based workflows — which demand more memory and higher throughput — run significantly faster on DGX Spark. Local control without cloud queues. Developers can run compute-heavy tasks locally instead of waiting for cloud instances or managing multiple environments. DGX Spark’s strengths go beyond LLMs. High-resolution diffusion models, for example, often require more memory than a typical desktop can provide. With FP4 support and large unified memory, DGX Spark can generate 1,000 images in just a few seconds and sustain higher throughput for creative or multimodal pipelines. The table below shows performance for fine-tuning the Llama family of models on DGX Spark. Performance for fine-tuning Llama family of models on DGX Spark.

      <title>Cheers to AI: ADAM Robot Bartender Makes Drinks at Vegas Golden Knights Game</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/adam-robot-vegas-golden-knights-thor/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In Las Vegas’s T-Mobile Arena, fans of the Golden Knights are getting more than just hockey — they’re getting a taste of the future. ADAM, a robot developed with NVIDIA Isaac libraries , is pouring drinks and turning heads in one of the NHL’s most exciting venues. ADAM, short for Automated Dual Arm Mixologist, was developed by Las-Vegas based Richtech Robotics. It’s not just a novelty — it’s a solution to real-world challenges in hospitality: labor shortages and demands for unique customer experiences. “The hospitality industry faces significant labor challenges, and ADAM is our answer to meeting those needs while elevating the customer experience,” said Matt Casella, president of Richtech Robotics. “With NVIDIA’s Isaac platform, we’ve developed a solution that’s scalable, consistent, and frankly, creates memorable moments for fans. The response at T-Mobile Arena has been phenomenal—people love interacting with ADAM.” Learning to Serve Drinks in Simulation Before ADAM ever poured a drink, it trained in a virtual bar. Richtech used NVIDIA Isaac Sim , an open-source, reference robotic simulation framework built on NVIDIA Omniverse , to build a high-fidelity and physically accurate simulation of ADAM’s workstation, complete with cups, utensils and lighting variations. The team generated synthetic data to teach ADAM how to recognize objects even in tricky conditions like glare or reflection. ADAM’s skills such as pouring and shaking were refined in simulation using Isaac Lab , NVIDIA’s open source robot learning framework. The result: a robot that doesn’t just follow instructions — it adapts to its environment with precision. Running Real-Time AI at the Edge With Jetson ADAM runs on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin , the powerful edge AI platform capable of 275 TOPS of compute. Using Isaac ROS 2 libraries, ADAM captures camera feeds, detects objects and calibrates the workspace in real time. ADAM’s perception stack — built with TAO Toolkit and optimized with TensorRT — enables it to identify cups, measure liquid levels and adjust movements with less than 40 milliseconds of latency. That means ADAM can spot a misplaced cup, detect when foam reaches the rim and correct a pour — all without missing a beat. Creating Industrial Dexterity With NVIDIA Thor While ADAM is busy serving drinks at Golden Knights games, Richtech Robotics is also making major strides in industrial automation with Dex, a new mobile humanoid robot built for factory and warehouse environments. Recently unveiled at GTC DC , Dex combines the mobility of an autonomous wheeled platform with the precision of dual-arm dexterity. It’s designed to handle such light-to-medium industrial tasks as machine operation, parts sorting, material handling and packaging — all with the flexibility to take on different tools and workflows. Dex runs on NVIDIA Jetson Thor , a next-generation robotics processor that gives it the ability to deliver real-time sensor processing and AI reason in dynamic industrial settings. Dex was trained from a blend of real world and synthetic data generated from Isaac Sim. This allowed Dex’s model to be generalized across a multitude of scenarios.

      <title>As AI Grows More Complex, Model Builders Rely on NVIDIA</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/leading-models-nvidia/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Unveiling what it describes as the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work, OpenAI launched GPT-5.2 today. The model was trained and deployed on NVIDIA infrastructure, including NVIDIA Hopper and GB200 NVL72 systems. It’s the latest example of how leading AI builders train and deploy at scale on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI infrastructure. Pretraining: The Bedrock of Intelligence AI models are getting more capable thanks to three scaling laws : pretraining, post-training and test-time scaling. Reasoning models , which apply compute during inference to tackle complex queries, using multiple networks working together, are now everywhere. But pretraining and post-training remain the bedrock of intelligence. They’re core to making reasoning models smarter and more useful. And getting there takes scale. Training frontier models from scratch isn’t a small job. It takes tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of GPUs working together effectively. That level of scale demands excellence across many dimensions. It requires world-class accelerators, advanced networking across scale-up, scale-out and increasingly scale-across architectures, plus a fully optimized software stack. In short, a purpose-built infrastructure platform built to deliver performance at scale. Compared with the NVIDIA Hopper architecture, NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems delivered 3x faster training performance on the largest model tested in the latest MLPerf Training industry benchmarks, and nearly 2x better performance per dollar . And NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 delivers a more than 4x speedup compared with NVIDIA Hopper. These performance gains help AI developers shorten development cycles and deploy new models more quickly. Proof in the Models Across Every Modality The majority of today’s leading large language models were trained on NVIDIA platforms. AI isn’t just about text. NVIDIA supports AI development across multiple modalities, including speech, image and video generation, as well as emerging areas like biology and robotics. For example, models like Evo 2 decode genetic sequences, OpenFold3 predicts 3D protein structures and Boltz-2 simulates drug interactions, helping researchers identify promising candidates faster. On the clinical side, NVIDIA Clara synthesis models generate realistic medical images to advance screening and diagnosis without exposing patient data. Companies like Runway and Inworld train on NVIDIA infrastructure. Runway last week announced Gen-4.5, a new frontier video generation model that’s the current top-rated video model in the world, according to the Artificial Analysis leaderboard. Now optimized for NVIDIA Blackwell, Gen-4.5 was developed entirely on NVIDIA GPUs across initial research and development, pre-training, post-training and inference. Runway also announced GWM-1, a state-of-the-art general world model trained on NVIDIA Blackwell that’s built to simulate reality in real time. It’s interactive, controllable and general-purpose, with applications in video games, education, science, entertainment and robotics. Benchmarks show why. MLPerf is the industry-standard benchmark for training performance. In the latest round, NVIDIA submitted results across all seven MLPerf Training 5.1 benchmarks , showing strong performance and versatility. It was the only platform to submit in every category. NVIDIA’s ability to support diverse AI workloads helps data centers use resources more efficiently. That’s why AI labs such as Black Forest Labs, Cohere, Mistral, OpenAI, Reflection and Thinking Machines Lab and are all training on the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. NVIDIA Blackwell Across Clouds and Data Centers NVIDIA Blackwell is widely available from leading cloud service providers, neo-clouds and server makers. And NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra, offering additional compute, memory and architecture improvements, is now rolling out from server makers and cloud service providers. Major cloud service providers and NVIDIA Cloud Partners , including Amazon Web Services, CoreWeave, Google Cloud, Lambda, Microsoft Azure, Nebius, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Together AI, to name a few, already offer instances powered by NVIDIA Blackwell, ensuring scalable performance as pretraining scaling continues. From frontier models to everyday AI, the future is being built on NVIDIA. Learn more about the NVIDIA Blackwell platform . Categories: Cloud | Corporate | Deep Learning]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At AWS re:Invent, NVIDIA and Amazon Web Services expanded their strategic collaboration with new technology integrations across interconnect technology, cloud infrastructure, open models and physical AI. As part of this expansion, AWS will support NVIDIA NVLink Fusion — a platform for custom AI infrastructure — for deploying its custom-designed silicon, including next-generation Trainium4 chips for inference and agentic AI model training, Graviton CPUs for a broad range of workloads and the Nitro System virtualization infrastructure. Using NVIDIA NVLink Fusion, AWS will combine NVIDIA NVLink scale-up interconnect and the NVIDIA MGX rack architecture with AWS custom silicon to increase performance and accelerate time to market for its next-generation cloud-scale AI capabilities. AWS is designing Trainium4 to integrate with NVLink and NVIDIA MGX, the first of a multigenerational collaboration between NVIDIA and AWS for NVLink Fusion. AWS has already deployed MGX racks at scale with NVIDIA GPUs. Integrating NVLink Fusion will allow AWS to further simplify deployment and systems management across its platforms. AWS can also harness the NVLink Fusion supplier ecosystem, which provides all the components required for full rack-scale deployment, from the rack and chassis, to power-delivery and cooling systems. By supporting AWS’s Elastic Fabric Adapter and Nitro System, the NVIDIA Vera Rubin architecture on AWS will give customers robust networking choices while maintaining full compatibility with AWS’s cloud infrastructure and accelerating new AI service rollout. “GPU compute demand is skyrocketing — more compute makes smarter AI, smarter AI drives broader use and broader use creates demand for even more compute. The virtuous cycle of AI has arrived,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA NVLink Fusion coming to AWS Trainium4, we’re unifying our scale-up architecture with AWS’s custom silicon to build a new generation of accelerated platforms. Together, NVIDIA and AWS are creating the compute fabric for the AI industrial revolution — bringing advanced AI to every company, in every country, and accelerating the world’s path to intelligence.” “AWS and NVIDIA have worked side by side for more than 15 years, and today marks a new milestone in that journey,” said Matt Garman, CEO of AWS. “With NVIDIA, we’re advancing our large-scale AI infrastructure to deliver customers the highest performance, efficiency and scalability. The upcoming support of NVIDIA NVLink Fusion in AWS Trainium4, Graviton and the Nitro System will bring new capabilities to customers so they can innovate faster than ever before.” Convergence of Scale and Sovereignty AWS has expanded its accelerated computing portfolio with the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, including NVIDIA HGX B300 and NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 GPUs, giving customers immediate access to the industry’s most advanced GPUs for training and inference. Availability of NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs, designed for visual applications, on AWS is expected in the coming weeks. These GPUs form part of the AWS infrastructure backbone powering AWS AI Factories, a new AI cloud offering that will provide customers around the world with the dedicated infrastructure they need to harness advanced AI services and capabilities in their own data centers, operated by AWS, while also letting customers maintain control of their data and comply with local regulations. NVIDIA and AWS are committing to deploy sovereign AI clouds globally and bring the best of AI innovation to the world. With the launch of AWS AI Factories, the companies are providing secure, sovereign AI infrastructure to deliver unprecedented computing capabilities for organizations around the world while meeting increasingly rigorous sovereign AI requirements. For public sector organizations, AWS AI Factories will transform the federal supercomputing and AI landscape. AWS AI Factories customers will be able to seamlessly integrate AWS’s industry-leading cloud infrastructure and services — known for its reliability, security and scalability — with NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs and the full-stack NVIDIA accelerated computing platform, including NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet switches. The unified architecture will ensure customers can access advanced AI services and capabilities, as well as train and deploy massive models, while maintaining absolute control of proprietary data and full compliance with local regulatory frameworks. NVIDIA Nemotron Integration With Amazon Bedrock Expands Software Optimizations Beyond hardware, the partnership expands integration of NVIDIA’s software stack with the AWS AI ecosystem. NVIDIA Nemotron open models are now integrated with Amazon Bedrock , enabling customers to build generative AI applications and agents at production scale. Developers can access Nemotron Nano 2 and Nemotron Nano 2 VL to build specialized agentic AI applications that process text, code, images and video with high efficiency and accuracy.

NVIDIA Software on AWS Simplifies Developer Experience NVIDIA and AWS are also co-engineering at the software layer to accelerate the data backbone of every enterprise. Amazon OpenSearch Service now offers serverless GPU acceleration for vector index building, powered by NVIDIA cuVS , an open-source library for GPU-accelerated vector search and data clustering. This milestone represents a fundamental shift to using GPUs for unstructured data processing, with early adopters seeing up to 10x faster vector indexing at a quarter of the cost. These dramatic gains reduce search latency, accelerate writes and unlock faster productivity for dynamic AI techniques like retrieval-augmented generation by delivering the right amount of GPU power precisely when it’s needed. AWS is the first major cloud provider to offer serverless vector indexing with NVIDIA GPUs. Production-ready AI agents require performance visibility, optimization and scalable infrastructure. By combining Strands Agents for agent development and orchestration, the NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit for deep profiling and performance tuning, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for secure, scalable agent infrastructure, organizations can empower developers with a complete, predictable path from prototype to production. This expanded support builds on AWS’s existing integrations with NVIDIA technologies — including NVIDIA NIM microservices and frameworks like NVIDIA Riva and NVIDIA BioNeMo , as well as model development tools integrated with Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock — that enable organizations to deploy agentic AI, speech AI and scientific applications faster than ever. Accelerating Physical AI With AWS Developing physical AI demands high-quality and diverse datasets for training robot models, as well as frameworks for testing and validation in simulation before real-world deployment. NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models (WFMs) are now available as NVIDIA NIM microservices on Amazon EKS , enabling real-time robotics control and simulation workloads with seamless reliability and cloud-native efficiency. For batch-based tasks and offline workloads such as large-scale synthetic data generation , Cosmos WFMs are also available on AWS Batch as containers.

      <title>At NeurIPS, NVIDIA Advances Open Model Development for Digital and Physical AI</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/neurips-open-source-digital-physical-ai/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Researchers worldwide rely on open-source technologies as the foundation of their work. To equip the community with the latest advancements in digital and physical AI, NVIDIA is further expanding its collection of open AI models, datasets and tools — with potential applications in virtually every research field. At NeurIPS , one of the world’s top AI conferences, NVIDIA is unveiling open physical AI models and tools to support research, including Alpamayo-R1, the world’s first industry-scale open reasoning vision language action (VLA) model for autonomous driving. In digital AI, NVIDIA is releasing new models and datasets for speech and AI safety. NVIDIA researchers are presenting over 70 papers, talks and workshops at the conference, sharing innovative projects that span AI reasoning, medical research, autonomous vehicle (AV) development and more. These initiatives deepen NVIDIA’s commitment to open source — an effort recognized by a new Openness Index from Artificial Analysis , an independent organization that benchmarks AI. The Artificial Analysis Open Index rates the NVIDIA Nemotron family of open technologies for frontier AI development among the most open in the AI ecosystem based on the permissibility of the model licenses, data transparency and availability of technical details. NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo-R1 Opens New Research Frontier for Autonomous Driving NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo-R1 (AR1) , the world’s first open reasoning VLA model for AV research, integrates chain-of-thought AI reasoning with path planning — a component critical for advancing AV safety in complex road scenarios and enabling level 4 autonomy . While previous iterations of self-driving models struggled with nuanced situations — a pedestrian-heavy intersection, an upcoming lane closure or a double-parked vehicle in a bike lane — reasoning gives autonomous vehicles the common sense to drive more like humans do. AR1 accomplishes this by breaking down a scenario and reasoning through each step. It considers all possible trajectories, then uses contextual data to choose the best route. For example, by tapping into the chain-of-thought reasoning enabled by AR1, an AV driving in a pedestrian-heavy area next to a bike lane could take in data from its path, incorporate reasoning traces — explanations on why it took certain actions — and use that information to plan its future trajectory, such as moving away from the bike lane or stopping for potential jaywalkers. https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/construction_worker.mp4 AR1’s open foundation, based on NVIDIA Cosmos Reason , lets researchers customize the model for their own non-commercial use cases, whether for benchmarking or building experimental AV applications. For post-training AR1, reinforcement learning has proven especially effective — researchers observed a significant improvement in reasoning capabilities with AR1 compared with the pretrained model. NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo-R1 is now available on GitHub and Hugging Face , and a subset of the data used to train and evaluate the model is available in the NVIDIA Physical AI Open Datasets . NVIDIA has also released the open-source AlpaSim framework to evaluate AR1. Learn more about reasoning VLA models for autonomous driving . Customizing NVIDIA Cosmos for Any Physical AI Use Case Developers can learn how to use and post-train Cosmos-based models using step-by-step recipes, quick-start inference examples and advanced post-training workflows now available in the Cosmos Cookbook . It’s a comprehensive guide for physical AI developers that covers every step in AI development, including data curation, synthetic data generation and model evaluation. There are virtually limitless possibilities for Cosmos-based applications. The latest examples from NVIDIA include: LidarGen , the first world model that can generate lidar data for AV simulation. Omniverse NuRec Fixer , a model for AV and robotics simulation that taps into NVIDIA Cosmos Predict to near-instantly address artifacts in neurally reconstructed data, such as blurs and holes from novel views or noisy data. Cosmos Policy , a framework for turning large pretrained video models into robust robot policies — a set of rules that dictate a robot’s behavior. ProtoMotions3 , an open-source, GPU-accelerated framework built on NVIDIA Newton and Isaac Lab for training physically simulated digital humans and humanoid robots with realistic scenes generated by Cosmos world foundation models (WFMs) . Sample outputs from the LidarGen model, built on Cosmos. The top row shows the input data with generated lidar data overlaid. The middle row shows generated and real lidar range maps. Bottom left shows the real lidar point cloud, while bottom right shows the point cloud generated by LidarGen. Policy models can be trained in NVIDIA Isaac Lab and Isaac Sim , and data generated from the policy models can then be used to post-train NVIDIA GR00T N models for robotics. Humanoid policy trained with ProtoMotions3 in Isaac Sim, with 3D background scene generated by Lyra with Cosmos WFM. NVIDIA ecosystem partners are developing their latest technologies with Cosmos WFMs. AV developer Voxel51 is contributing model recipes to the Cosmos Cookbook. Physical AI developers 1X , Figure AI, Foretellix, Gatik, Oxa, PlusAI and X-Humanoid are using WFMs for their latest physical AI applications. And researchers at ETH Zurich are presenting a NeurIPS paper that highlights using Cosmos models for realistic and cohesive 3D scene creation. NVIDIA Nemotron Additions Bolster the Digital AI Developer Toolkit NVIDIA is also releasing new multi-speaker speech AI models, a new model with reasoning capabilities and datasets for AI safety, as well as open tools to generate high-quality synthetic datasets for reinforcement learning and domain-specific model customization. These tools include: MultiTalker Parakeet : An automatic speech recognition model for streaming audio that can understand multiple speakers, even in overlapped or fast-paced conversations. Sortformer : A state-of-the-art model that can accurately distinguish multiple speakers within an audio stream — a process called diarization — in real time. Nemotron Content Safety Reasoning : A reasoning-based AI safety model that dynamically enforces custom policies across domains. Nemotron Content Safety Audio Dataset : A synthetic dataset that helps train models to detect unsafe audio content, enabling the development of guardrails that work across text and audio modalities. NeMo Gym : an open-source library that accelerates and simplifies the development of reinforcement learning environments for LLM training. NeMo Gym also contains a growing collection of ready-to-use training environments to enable Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR). NeMo Data Designer Library : Now open-sourced under Apache 2.0, this library provides an end-to-end toolkit to generate, validate and refine high-quality synthetic datasets for generative AI development, including domain-specific model customization and evaluation. NVIDIA ecosystem partners using NVIDIA Nemotron and NeMo tools to build secure, specialized agentic AI include CrowdStrike, Palantir and ServiceNow. NeurIPS attendees can explore these innovations at the Nemotron Summit , taking place today, from 4-8 p.m. PT, with an opening address by Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA. NVIDIA Research Furthers Language AI Innovation Of the dozens of NVIDIA-authored research papers at NeurIPS , here are a few highlights advancing language models: Audio Flamingo 3: Advancing Audio Intelligence With Fully Open Large Audio Language Models : This large audio language model is capable of reasoning across speech, sound and music. It can understand and reason audio segments up to 10 minutes in length, achieving state-of-the-art results on over 20 benchmarks. Minitron-SSM: Efficient Hybrid Language Model Compression Through Group-Aware SSM Pruning : This poster introduces a pruning method capable of compressing hybrid models, demonstrated by pruning and distilling Nemotron-H 8B from 8 billion to 4 billion parameters. The resulting model surpasses the accuracy of similarly sized models while achieving 2x faster inference throughput. Jet-Nemotron: Efficient Language Model With Post Neural Architecture Search : This work presents a cost-efficient post-training pipeline for developing new efficient language model architectures, and introduces a hybrid-architecture model family produced with the pipeline. These models match or surpass the accuracy of leading full-attention baselines while delivering substantially higher generation throughput. Nemotron-Flash: Towards Latency-Optimal Hybrid Small Language Models : This project introduces a new small language model (SLM) architecture that redesigns SLMs around real-world latency rather than parameter count — achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy. ProRL: Prolonged Reinforcement Learning Expands Reasoning Boundaries in Large Language Models : Prolonged reinforcement learning, or ProRL, is a technique that extends model training over longer periods. In this NeurIPS poster, NVIDIA researchers describe how this methodology results in models that consistently outperform base models for reasoning.

      <title>FLUX.2 Image Generation Models Now Released, Optimized for NVIDIA RTX GPUs</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-flux-2-comfyui/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Black Forest Labs — the frontier AI research lab developing visual generative AI models — today released the FLUX.2 family of state-of-the-art image generation models. FLUX.2 is packed with new tools and capabilities, including a multi-reference feature that can generate dozens of similar image variations, in photorealistic detail and with cleaner fonts — even at scale. NVIDIA has worked with Black Forest Labs and ComfyUI to make the models available with FP8 quantizations and RTX GPU performance optimizations at launch, decreasing the VRAM required to run them by 40% and improving performance by 40%. Requiring no special software package to run, the models are available directly in ComfyUI . State-of-the-Art Visual Intelligence Images generated by FLUX.2 are photorealistic, even at scale, featuring up to 4 megapixel resolution with real-world lighting and physics to eliminate that “AI look” that undermines visual fidelity. The models add direct pose control to explicitly specify the pose of a subject or character in an image, as well as deliver clean, readable text across infographics, user interface screens and even multilingual content. Plus, the new multi-reference feature enables artists to select up to six reference images where the style or subject stays consistent — eliminating the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Stunning, photorealistic details. Image courtesy of Black Forest Labs. For a complete overview of new FLUX.2 features, read Black Forest Labs’ blog . Optimized for RTX The new FLUX.2 models are impressive, but also quite demanding. They run a staggering 32-billion-parameter model requiring 90GB VRAM to load completely. Even using lowVRAM mode — a popular setting that allows artists to only load the active model at a time — the VRAM requirement is still 64GB, which puts the model virtually out of reach for any consumer card to use effectively. To broaden FLUX.2 model accessibility, NVIDIA and Black Forest Labs collaborated to quantize the model to FP8 — reducing the VRAM requirements by 40% at comparable quality. FLUX.2 is here. And to make this model accessible on GeForce RTX GPUs, NVIDIA has partnered with ComfyUI — a popular application to run visual generative AI models on PC — to improve the app’s RAM offload feature, known as weight streaming. Using the upgraded feature, users can offload parts of the model to system memory, extending the available memory on their GPUs — albeit with some performance loss, as system memory is slower than GPU memory. NVIDIA has also been collaborating with ComfyUI to optimize model performance on NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPUs, including optimizations for FP8 checkpoints. Get started with FLUX.2 today. Update ComfyUI and check out the FLUX.2 templates, or visit Black Forest Labs’ Hugging Face page to download the model weights.

      <title>AI On: 3 Ways Specialized AI Agents Are Reshaping Businesses</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/specialized-ai-agents/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Editor’s note: This post is part of the AI On blog series, which explores the latest techniques and real-world applications of agentic AI, chatbots and copilots. The series also highlights the NVIDIA software and hardware powering advanced AI agents, which form the foundation of AI query engines that gather insights and perform tasks to transform everyday experiences and reshape industries. As agentic AI adoption continues to grow, with open-source models and tools maturing, companies across industries are increasingly asking: what AI agents should we build to solve our unique business challenges? Although faster outcomes are a core benefit of using AI, organizations are finding that specialization is the key to business impact and long-term AI adoption. Rather than relying on one-size-fits-all models and services, leading companies are developing specialized AI agents designed to understand and act within the needs of a specific use case. CrowdStrike, PayPal and Synopsys are examples of companies combining NVIDIA Nemotron open foundation models with their proprietary data and institutional knowledge to create specialized applications. The results are intelligent agents that have the level of expertise required to work alongside human colleagues and boost business operations. 1. CrowdStrike Defends Against Modern Cyber Threats In cybersecurity, speed and precision are essential, especially as cyber threats become more advanced and grow to larger scales. To meet these rapidly evolving digital threats, CrowdStrike is building specialized AI agents that can work alongside security teams through Charlotte AI AgentWorks. These agents, powered by NVIDIA Nemotron open models and NVIDIA NIM microservices, automate high-volume tasks such as alert triage and remediation, allowing human analysts to focus on higher-order decision-making. Built on open models and continuously trained by incident responders, CrowdStrike’s Agentic Security Platform increases accuracy of alert triage from 80% to 98.5% , reducing security analyst teams’ manual effort tenfold. The platform can adapt to new risks and collaborates across the security operations center. 2. PayPal’s AI Agents Power Frictionless Commerce at Scale PayPal, a leader in payments and e-commerce, is building agent-driven infrastructure to accelerate intelligent commerce . The company’s specialized AI agents, developed on Nemotron open models, will enable the first wave of conversational commerce experiences, where agents can shop, buy and pay on a user’s behalf. With this approach, PayPal built a fine-tuning pipeline in two weeks and reduced latency by nearly 50% while maintaining the high accuracy required to serve its 430 million customers and 30 million merchants. PayPal’s agents rely on open, modular models that are fine-tuned specifically for payments and commerce, giving the company the control to balance performance, accuracy and cost at a massive scale. 3. Synopsys Advances Agentic AI for Chip Design Workflows The complexity of modern semiconductor design and manufacturing calls for expertise, precision and speed.

      <title>Into the Omniverse: How Smart City AI Agents Transform Urban Operations</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/smart-city-ai-agents-urban-operations/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Editor’s note: This post is part of Into the Omniverse , a series focused on how developers, 3D practitioners and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advancements in OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse . Cities worldwide face unprecedented challenges as urban populations surge and infrastructure strains to keep pace. Operational challenges like traffic congestion and coordinating emergency services are compounded by fragmented data pipelines, siloed local government processes and disparate systems. Technical barriers prevent cities from accessing the comprehensive, real-time insights needed for effective decision-making and city management. Leading cities and technology partners are deploying the NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city AI , a reference application that provides the complete software stack to build, test and operate AI agents in simulation-ready ( SimReady ) digital twins. OpenUSD is an open and extensible framework that connects to each stage of this physical AI workflow. OpenUSD-enabled digital twins serve as SimReady environments where cities can simulate “what if” scenarios and generate physically accurate sensor data. The blueprint powers a three-stage workflow: 1) simulate with the NVIDIA Cosmos platform and NVIDIA Omniverse libraries to generate synthetic data, 2) train and fine-tune vision AI models, and 3) deploy real-time video analytics AI agents with the NVIDIA Metropolis platform and the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization (VSS). This enables cities to move from reactive to proactive operations.​ Based on these simulations, cities can deploy operational platforms where weather data, traffic sensors and emergency response systems converge, supporting rapid testing of rare scenarios, real-time monitoring, city infrastructure planning and optimization of urban systems. From Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, cutting incident response times by 80% with street-level AI to Raleigh, North Carolina, achieving 95% vehicle detection accuracy and French rail networks optimizing energy consumption by 20%, cities across the globe are using digital twins and AI agents to transform urban operations at scale. Smart Cities in Action Akila, With SNCF Gares&Connexions, Uses Digital Twins to Improve Rail Operations Akila’s digital twin application helps French rail operator SNCF Gares&Connexions optimize its network of nearly 14,000 daily trains with live scenario planning for solar heating, air flow and crowd movement. The OpenUSD-enabled digital twins deliver a 20% reduction in energy consumption, 100% on-time preventive maintenance and a 50% reduction in downtime and response times. Linker Vision Taps Physical AI for Street-Level Intelligence Linker Vision’s physical AI system recognizes infrastructure events in Kaohsiung City, including damaged streetlights and fallen trees, eliminating manual city inspections and enabling faster emergency response. To scale its street-level intelligence to more cities, Linker Vision uses Omniverse libraries for simulation, Cosmos Reason for world understanding and the VSS blueprint for deployment powered by OpenUSD. Esri and Microsoft Enable Comprehensive Urban Intelligence in the City of Raleigh The City of Raleigh achieved 95% vehicle detection accuracy using the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit, boosting traffic analysis workflows for engineers. This data enhances Raleigh’s digital twin, enabled by Esri’s ArcGIS geospatial platform to support visualization and analysis for critical infrastructure planning and management. Integrating this computer vision pipeline with a vision AI agent powered by the NVIDIA VSS blueprint provides comprehensive real-time visibility and insights in ArcGIS on Azure Cloud. Milestone Systems’ VLM Automates Video Review Milestone Systems is soon launching its Hafnia VLM, which will include a VLM plug-in for its video management software XProtect as well as a VLM-as-a-service. Fine-tuned on more than 75,000 hours of video data, the Hafnia VLM can reduce operator alarm fatigue by up to 30% by automating video review and filtering out false alarms. It was developed with NVIDIA Cosmos Reason VLMs and Metropolis. The Hafnia VLM plug-in for XProtect will make generative AI more easily accessible for XProtect operators and users. K2K Analyzes Italy Video Streams K2K’s platform uses NVIDIA Cosmos Reason and the VSS blueprint to analyze over 1,000 video streams in Palermo, Italy, processing 7 billion events annually and automatically notifying city officials through natural language queries and video events when critical conditions are extracted and analyzed.
