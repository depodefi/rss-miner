      <title>AI Copilot Keeps Berkeley’s X-Ray Particle Accelerator on Track</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-copilot-berkeley-x-ray-particle-accelerator/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[In the rolling hills of Berkeley, California, an AI agent is supporting high-stakes physics experiments at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) particle accelerator. Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ALS facility recently deployed the Accelerator Assistant, a large language model (LLM)-driven system to keep X-ray research on track. The Accelerator Assistant — powered by an NVIDIA H100 GPU harnessing CUDA for accelerated inference — taps into institutional knowledge data from the ALS support team and routes requests through Gemini, Claude or ChatGPT. It writes Python and solves problems, either autonomously or with a human in the loop. This is no small task. The ALS particle accelerator sends electrons traveling near the speed of light in a 200-yard circular path, emitting ultraviolet and X-ray light, which is directed through 40 beamlines for 1,700 scientific experiments per year. Scientists worldwide use this process to study materials science, biology, chemistry, physics and environmental science. At the ALS, beam interruptions can last minutes, hours or days, depending on the complexity, halting concurrent scientific experiments in process. And much can go wrong: the ALS control system has more than 230,000 process variables. “It’s really important for such a machine to be up, and when we go down, there are 40 beamlines that do X-ray experiments, and they are waiting,” said Thorsten Hellert, staff scientist from the Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics Division at Berkeley Lab and lead author of a research paper on the groundbreaking work. Until now, facility staff troubleshooting issues have had to quickly identify the areas, retrieve data and gather the right personnel for analysis under intense time pressure to get the system back up and running. “The novel approach offers a blueprint for securely and transparently applying large language model-driven systems to particle accelerators, nuclear and fusion reactor facilities, and other complex scientific infrastructures,” said Hellert. The research team demonstrated that the Accelerator Assistant can autonomously prepare and run a multistage physics experiment, cutting setup time and reducing efforts by 100x. Applying Context Engineering Prompts to Accelerator Assistant The ALS operators interact with the system through either a command line interface or Open WebUI, which enables interaction with various LLMs and is accessible from control room stations, as well as remotely. Under the hood, the system uses Osprey, a framework developed at Berkeley Lab to apply agent-based AI safely in complex control systems. Each user is authenticated and the framework maintains personalized context and memory across sessions, and multiple sessions can be managed simultaneously. This allows users to organize distinct tasks or experiments into separate threads. These inputs are routed through the Accelerator Assistant, which makes connections to the database of more than 230,000 process variables, a historical database archive service and Jupyter Notebook-based execution environments. “We try to engineer the context of every language model call with whatever prior knowledge we have from this execution up to this point,” said Hellert. Inference is done either locally — using Ollama, which is an open-source tool for running LLMs with a personal computer, on an H100 GPU node located within the control room network — or externally with the CBorg gateway, which is a lab-managed interface that routes requests to external tools such as ChatGPT, Claude or Gemini. The hybrid architecture balances secure, low-latency, on-premises inference with access to the latest foundation models. Integration with EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) enables operator-standard safety constraints for direct interaction with accelerator hardware. EPICS is a distributed control system used in large-scale scientific facilities such as particle accelerators. Engineers can write Python code in Jupyter Notebook that can communicate with it. Basically, conversational input is turned into a clear natural language task description for objectives without redundancy. External knowledge such as personalized memory tied to users, documentation and accelerator databases are integrated to assist with terminology and context. “It’s a large facility with a lot of specialized expertise,” said Hellert. “Much of that knowledge is scattered across teams, so even finding something simple — like the address of a temperature sensor in one part of the machine — can take time.” Tapping Accelerator Assistant to Aid Engineers, Fusion Energy Development Using the Accelerator Assistant, engineers can start with a simple prompt describing their goal. Behind the scenes, the system draws on carefully prepared examples and keywords from accelerator operations to guide the LLM’s reasoning. “Each prompt is engineered with relevant context from our facility, so the model already knows what kind of task it’s dealing with,” said Hellert. Each agent is an expert in that field, he said. Once the task is defined, the agent brings together its specialized capabilities — such as finding process variables or navigating the control system — and can automatically generate and run Python scripts to analyze data, visualize results or interact safely with the accelerator itself. “This is something that can save you serious time — in the paper, we say two orders of magnitude for such a prompt,” said Hellert. Looking ahead, Hellert aims to have the ALS engineers put together a wiki that documents the many processes that go on to support the experiments. These documents could help the agents run the facilities autonomously — with a human in the loop to approve the course of action. “On these high-stakes scientific experiments, even if it’s just a TEM microscope or something that might cost $1 million, a human in the loop can be very important,” said Hellert. The work has already expanded beyond ALS as part of the DOE’s Genesys mission, with the framework being deployed across U.S. particle accelerator facilities. Next up, Hellert just began collaborating with engineers at the ITER fusion reactor — the world’s largest — in France for implementing the framework for use in the fusion reactor facility. He also has a collaboration in the works with the Extremely Large Telescope ELT, in northern Chile. Benefiting Humanity: Scientific Impact of Experiments Supported by ALS Beyond optimizing the accelerator and other industrial operations, the work at the ALS directly enables scientific breakthroughs with global impact. The facility’s stable X-ray beams underpin research in health, climate resilience and planetary science. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ALS researchers helped characterize a rare antibody that could neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Structural biology experiments at Beamline 4.2.2 revealed how six molecular loops of the antibody latch onto and disable the viral spike protein. The findings supported the rapid development of a therapeutic that remained effective through multiple variants. ALS science also contributes to climate-focused research. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) — a class of porous materials capable of capturing water or carbon dioxide from air — were extensively studied across several ALS beamlines. These experiments supported foundational work that ultimately led to the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, recognizing the transformative potential of MOFs for sustainable water harvesting and carbon management. In planetary science, ALS measurements of samples returned from NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission helped trace the chemical history of asteroid Bennu. X-ray analyses provided evidence that such asteroids carried water and molecular precursors of life to early Earth, deepening our understanding of the origins of the planet’s habitable conditions.

      <title>Japan Science and Technology Agency Develops NVIDIA-Powered Moonshot Robot for Elderly Care</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/japan-science-technology-agency-develops-moonshot-robot/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The next universal technology since the smartphone is on the horizon — and it may be a little less pocket friendly. The Moonshot research program, funded by the Japan Science and Technology Agency and accelerated by NVIDIA AI and robotics technologies, is working to create a world by 2050 where AI-powered, autonomously learning robots are integrated into Japanese citizens’ everyday lives. That’s just goal No. 3 of the broader Moonshot initiative, which includes researchers from across Japan’s universities and comprises 10 ambitious technology goals — from ultra-early disease prediction to sustainable resource circulation. In light of Japan’s rising elderly population, many of the research projects underway center on how robots can aid in senior care. This includes designing a robot that’s capable of caregiving tasks like cooking, cleaning and hygiene care. NVIDIA Architecture Powers On Moonshot Robots NVIDIA technologies are integrated into every level of the Moonshot project’s senior care robots known as AI-Driven Robot for Embrace and Care, or AIREC. Dry-AIREC robot, the larger and more mobile member of the Moonshot family, has two NVIDIA GPUs onboard. For AIREC-Basic, primarily used for data collection for the motion foundation model, three NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX modules power AI processing at the edge. Pictured is AIREC-Basic (left) and AIREC-Basic (right). Plus, NVIDIA Isaac Sim , an open-source robotic simulation framework, was used to train the AIREC robots to perform specific tasks, such as estimating the forces between objects. The integration of NVIDIA technologies and AI into the robot development process has allowed this project to go from a far-fetched dream to reality faster than imagined. “Five years ago, before generative AI, few people believed that this application was possible,” said Tetsuya Ogata, professor and director of the Institute for AI and Robotics at Waseda University. “Now, the atmosphere surrounding this technology has changed, so we can seriously think about this kind of application.” Building a Full Set of Caregiving Capabilities Additional research projects are underway to develop the Moonshot robot’s elderly-care capabilities. “We’re focusing on things like changing diapers, helping patients take baths and providing meal assistance, so those actions can be supported by the robots, and caregivers can focus on improving the patients’ lives,” said Misa Matsumura, a bioengineering master’s student at the University of Tokyo. A recent paper by Matsumura — presented at the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems — focused on repositioning, an essential action in elderly care to prevent bed sores and enable diaper changing. Automating repositioning with a humanoid robot — while considering the elderly care patients’ personal states and bodily needs — is no easy feat. To train the Dry-AIREC robots for this research endeavor, Matsumura’s team used laptops powered by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. Matsumura used 3D posture estimation, trajectory calculations and force estimation to further develop the robots’ capabilities. Dry-AIREC’s fisheye and depth cameras helped assess the movements required to reposition patients. The exact repositioning method needed for a patient is found through trajectory calculations based on movement data from skilled caregivers. The robot must also use the right amount of force in repositioning to complete the action without causing the patient pain. By predicting the pressure required to press the shoulders and knees, it determines the appropriate timing for movement — enabling actions with the ideal applied force. Preliminary experiments were done using mannequins, and Matsumura’s research has now advanced to incorporate humans testing the robots. Matsumura is conducting ongoing research to further improve this action for Dry-AIREC. Milestone images for goal No. 3 for the Japan Science and Technology Agency. Among the many projects within the Moonshot program, developing robots for elderly care has particular significance for some of the researchers due to the project’s social and personal implications. “Although my study focus is on medical robotics, I decided to join this project because my mother is growing older, and that experience has given me an appreciation for the importance of personal care,” said Etsuko Kobayashi, professor of bioengineering at the University of Tokyo and Matsumura’s graduate advisor. “I found that my experience in medical robotics can be meaningfully extended to care robotics, contributing to the development of safe and reliable robotic systems for human-centered applications.” The Moonshot team for goal No. 3 will showcase their progress at the 2026 International Symposium on System Integration in January.

      <title>From Warehouse to Wallet: New State of AI in Retail and CPG Survey Uncovers How AI Is Rewiring Supply Chains and Customer Experiences</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ai-in-retail-cpg-survey-2026/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[AI has transformed retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) operations, enhancing customer analysis and segmentation to enable greater personalization for marketing and advertising, and boosting the speed and accuracy of demand forecasting for supply chains and logistics. Companies are also raising the bar for customer engagement through intelligent digital shopping assistants and catalog enrichment by dynamically enhancing and localizing product information. AI agents are increasing the speed and efficiency of operations, while physical AI systems are helping streamline and automate warehouse and supply chain operations. NVIDIA’s third annual State of AI in Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods survey report, which garnered hundreds of responses, showed maturation of AI within the industry as companies move AI projects from pilot to production in all areas. Highlights of this year’s report include: 91% of respondents said their companies are either actively using or assessing AI. 90% said they’d build on the success of current projects by increasing their AI budgets in 2026. 89% reported AI is helping to increase annual revenue, while 95% said it is helping decrease annual costs. 79% said open-source models and software were moderately to extremely important to their AI strategy. 47% said their companies are either using or assessing agentic AI in their operations. Read more below on some of the report’s key findings. Open Source Opens Opportunities Open source has quickly become the foundation of many retail AI systems, giving teams the flexibility to adapt models to their data and use cases while maintaining strong governance. Open, interoperable ecosystems also make it easier to plug AI into existing tools and workflows, helping retailers rapidly scale innovation. “Most retailers first started experimenting with AI using proprietary AI vendors,” said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer of Publicis Groupe. “They had the models, but they didn’t own the keys to their own kingdom. Open source flips that script, allowing retailers to leverage their proprietary data, avoid vendor lock-in and benefit from open-source community innovation.” AI Unlocks Significant Business Impact With 91% of respondents saying their companies are either actively using or assessing AI, the competitive question in retail and CPG has shifted from whether or not to invest in AI, to how to most effectively deploy and scale AI. Across the industry, the business impact of AI has been tangible and significant. When asked how AI has improved their business, 54% cited improved employee productivity; 52% said AI has helped to create operational efficiencies; and 41% reported improved customer service. As stated above, 89% of respondents said AI has helped to increase revenue. For many companies, that increase has been significant, with 30% stating revenue has increased by more than 10%. The story is the same for AI’s role in helping to decrease annual costs, with 95% agreeing AI has reduced costs and 37% saying costs have been reduced by more than 10%. “What executives should be focused on is not green-lighting vanity projects at the expense of high-ROI wins,” said Chris Walton, co-CEO of Omni Talk. “The retailers who will succeed will start with boring use cases that solve specific P&L problems, prove the value, then scale.” AI investment, including infrastructure, hiring AI experts and software, will increase next year, according to nine out of 10 survey respondents. And half of respondents said the increase could be significant, with budgets increasing 10% or more year over year. Agentic AI Makes Big Debut in Retail The retail and CPG industry is piloting AI agents across lines of business. Overall, 47% of survey respondents said they’re using or assessing agentic AI — with 20% saying AI agents are already active in their organizations and another 21% reporting agents are coming within the next year. “The truly disruptive impact of agentic AI will hit retail supply chains and operations first, such as autonomous agents handling real-time inventory rebalancing, dynamic pricing and vendor negotiations at scale, because that’s where the ROI is measurable,” said Walton. Survey respondents identified three clear goals for agentic AI in retail and CPG: Increased process speed and efficiency, per 57% of respondents. Enhanced customer experience and personalization, per 40%. Improved decision-making with real-time data, per 40%. Broadly speaking, agentic AI will be spread across three operational lines: internal operations, employee and customer support, and customer engagement. For instance, in customer engagement, agents go beyond analytics and act on insights in real time, adjust messages, recommend products and guide purchase decisions based on individual customer contexts. AI Providing Resilience to the Supply Chain Retail and CPG have faced intense supply chain challenges this decade, and those challenges are only growing more complex. Sixty-four percent of respondents in this year’s survey reported increased challenges in the supply chain year over year, such as geopolitical instability, labor constraints, evolving consumer expectations for speed and transparency, and regulatory complexity across global operations. “AI lets retailers optimize inventory at the store and customer level rather than at a regional level,” said Goldberg. “AI allows retailers to incorporate many more factors in their demand forecasts, and much more accurately predict and avoid out of stocks, by much more accurately matching supply to demand.” The industry is turning to AI to streamline operations and solve complexity. The top pressure valve is using AI for supply chain operational efficiency and throughput, according to 51% of respondents. Meeting customer expectations was next on the list at 45%, and solving for traceability and transparency was third, per 38%. Physical AI is gaining ground in the industry, with 17% of respondents using or evaluating the technology. “The real transformation will come from AI that makes existing physical infrastructure smarter,” said Walton. “My favorite example is in-store robotics. Through them, you get better pricing, better inventory, management and better presentation quality.” The early movers demonstrate that, when integrated thoughtfully, physical AI systems deliver more than task automation, enhancing flexibility and throughput in response to workforce pressures and rising logistical complexity.

      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-ces-2026-open-models-video-generation/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[2025 marked a breakout year for AI development on PC. PC-class small language models (SLMs) improved accuracy by nearly 2x over 2024, dramatically closing the gap with frontier cloud-based large language models (LLMs). AI PC developer tools including Ollama, ComfyUI, llama.cpp and Unsloth have matured, their popularity has doubled year over year and the number of users downloading PC-class models grew tenfold from 2024. These developments are paving the way for generative AI to gain widespread adoption among everyday PC creators, gamers and productivity users this year. At CES this week, NVIDIA is announcing announcing a wave of AI upgrades for GeForce RTX, NVIDIA RTX PRO and NVIDIA DGX Spark devices that unlock the performance and memory needed for developers to deploy generative AI on PC, including: Up to 3x performance and 60% reduction in VRAM for video and image generative AI via PyTorch-CUDA optimizations and native NVFP4/FP8 precision support in ComfyUI . RTX Video Super Resolution integration in ComfyUI, accelerating 4K video generation. NVIDIA NVFP8 optimizations for the open weights release of Lightricks’ state-of-the-art LTX-2 audio-video generation model . A new video generation pipeline for generating 4K AI video using a 3D scene in Blender to precisely control outputs. Up to 35% faster inference performance for SLMs via Ollama and llama.cpp. RTX acceleration for Nexa.ai ’s Hyperlink new video search capability. These advancements will allow users to seamlessly run advanced video, image and language AI workflows with the privacy, security and low latency offered by local RTX AI PCs. Generate Videos 3x Faster and in 4K on RTX PCs Generative AI can make amazing videos, but online tools can be difficult to control with just prompts. And trying to generate 4K videos is near impossible, as most models are too large to fit on PC VRAM. Today, NVIDIA is introducing an RTX-powered video generation pipeline that enables artists to gain accurate control over their generations while generating videos 3x faster and upscaling them to 4K — only using a fraction of the VRAM. This video pipeline allows emerging artists to create a storyboard, turn it into photorealistic keyframes and then turn these keyframes into a high-quality, 4K video. The pipeline is split into three blueprints that artists can mix and match or modify to their needs: A 3D object generator that creates assets for scenes. A 3D-guided image generator that allows users to set their scene in Blender and generate photorealistic keyframes from it. A video generator that follows a user’s start and end key frames to animate their video, and uses NVIDIA RTX Video technology to upscale it to 4K This pipeline is possible by the groundbreaking release of the new LTX-2 model from Lightricks, available for download today. A major milestone for local AI video creation, LTX-2 delivers results that stand toe-to-toe with leading cloud-based models while generating up to 20 seconds of 4K video with impressive visual fidelity. The model features built-in audio, multi-keyframe support and advanced conditioning capabilities enhanced with controllability low-rank adaptations — giving creators cinematic-level quality and control without relying on cloud dependencies. Under the hood, the pipeline is powered by ComfyUI. Over the past few months, NVIDIA has worked closely with ComfyUI to optimize performance by 40% on NVIDIA GPUs, and the latest update adds support for the NVFP4 and NVFP8 data formats. All combined, performance is 3x faster and VRAM is reduced by 60% with RTX 50 Series’ NVFP4 format, and performance is 2x faster and VRAM is reduced by 40% with NVFP8. NVFP4 and NVFP8 checkpoints are now available for some of the top models directly in ComfyUI. These models include LTX-2 from Lightricks, FLUX.1 and FLUX.2 from Black Forest Labs, and Qwen-Image and Z-Image from Alibaba. Download them directly in ComfyUI, with additional model support coming soon. Once a video clip is generated, videos are upscaled to 4K in just seconds using the new RTX Video node in ComfyUI. This upscaler works in real time, sharpens edges and cleans up compression artifacts for a clear final image. RTX Video will be available in ComfyUI next month. To help users push beyond the limits of GPU memory, NVIDIA has collaborated with ComfyUI to improve its memory offload feature, known as weight streaming. With weight streaming enabled, ComfyUI can use system RAM when it runs out of VRAM, enabling larger models and more complex multistage node graphs on mid-range RTX GPUs. The video generation workflow will be available for download next month, with the newly released open weights of the LTX-2 Video Model and ComfyUI RTX updates available now. A New Way to Search PC Files and Videos File searching on PCs has been the same for decades. It still mostly relies on file names and spotty metadata, which makes tracking down that one document from last year way harder than it should be. Hyperlink — Nexa.ai’s local search agent — turns RTX PCs into a searchable knowledge base that can answer questions in natural language with inline citations. It can scan and index documents, slides, PDFs and images, so searches can be driven by ideas and content instead of file name guesswork. All data is processed locally and stays on the user’s PC for privacy and security. Plus, it’s RTX-accelerated, taking 30 seconds per gigabyte to index text and image files and three seconds for a response on a RTX 5090 GPU, compared with an hour per gigabyte to index files and 90 seconds for a response on CPUs. At CES, Nexa.ai is unveiling a new beta version of Hyperlink that adds support for video content, enabling users to search through their videos for objects, actions and speech. This is ideal for users ranging from video artists looking for B-roll to gamers who want to find that time they won a battle royale match to share with their friends. For those interested in trying the Hyperlink private beta, sign up for access on this webpage . Access will roll out starting this month. Small Language Models Get 35% Faster NVIDIA has collaborated with the open‑source community to deliver major performance gains for SLMs on RTX GPUs and the NVIDIA DGX Spark desktop supercomputer using Llama.cpp and Ollama. The latest changes are especially beneficial for mixture-of-experts models, including the new NVIDIA Nemotron 3 family of open models . SLM inference performance has improved by 35% and 30% for llama.cpp and Ollama, respectively, over the past four months. These updates are available now, and a quality-of-life upgrade for llama.cpp also speeds up LLM loading times. These speedups will be available in the next update of LM Studio, and will be coming soon to agentic apps like the new MSI AI Robot app. The MSI AI Robot app, which also takes advantage of the Llama.cpp optimizations, lets users control their MSI device settings and will incorporate the latest updates in an upcoming release. NVIDIA Broadcast 2.1 Brings Virtual Key Light to More PC Users The NVIDIA Broadcast app improves the quality of a user’s PC microphone and webcam with AI effects, ideal for livestreaming and video conferencing. Version 2.1 updates the Virtual Key Light effect to improve performance — making it available to RTX 3060 desktop GPUs and higher — handle more lighting conditions, offer broader color temperature control and use an updated HDRi base map for a two‑key‑light style often seen in professional streams. Download the NVIDIA Broadcast update today. Transform an At-Home Creative Studio Into an AI Powerhouse With DGX Spark As new and increasingly capable AI models arrive on PC each month, developer interest in more powerful and flexible local AI setups continues to grow. DGX Spark — a compact AI supercomputer that fits on users’ desks and pairs seamlessly with a primary desktop or laptop — enables experimenting, prototyping and running advanced AI workloads alongside an existing PC. Spark is ideal for those interested in testing out LLMs or prototyping agentic workflows, or for artists who want to generate assets in parallel to their workflow so that their main PC is still available for editing. At CES, NVIDIA is unveiling major AI performance updates to Spark, delivering up to 2.6x faster performance since it launched just under three months ago. New DGX Spark playbooks are also available, including one for speculative decoding and another to fine-tune models with two DGX Spark modules.

      <title>Marine Biological Laboratory Explores Human Memory With AI and Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mbl-human-memory-ai-vr-rtx/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The works of Plato state that when humans have an experience, some level of change occurs in their brain, which is powered by memory — specifically long-term memory. This change is what Andre Fenton, professor of neural science at New York University, and Abhishek Kumar, assistant professor of cell and regenerative biology at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, are studying at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. “My life’s work is to understand how minds operate, and especially to understand memory — not merely as a trace of the past in the brain but as an estimate of the future that the brain is afforded,” Fenton said. The researchers have upleveled their project by harnessing NVIDIA RTX GPUs and HP Z Workstations to visualize massive datasets and by integrating custom AI tools and syGlass , a virtual-reality (VR) platform for scientific exploration. This project is additionally supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. A Neural Forest Uncovered Memory is the job of the brain’s hippocampus. This C-shaped structure, resembling a seahorse, is the main focus of the MBL research group. Fenton describes the cells within the hippocampus as a forest, where billions of neurons look like tiny tree trunks and the lines coming off the trunks look like leaves. Projection image of neuronal cell nuclei (left) and dendrites (right) or branched extensions of a nerve cell. Images were acquired by Matthew Parent and Daryl Watkins. The team is studying a small portion of these “leaves” — representing protein markers: an incredibly tedious task due to their length, at about a micrometer each. A researcher must search through the forest of brain cells to find the correct protein markers, which make up only about 1% of all protein markers in the hippocampus. The researchers were looking to ease the process of studying these proteins and what their varying structures may reveal about memory encoding. Collecting and analyzing enough 3D volumetric data on protein markers was a bottleneck within the project until NVIDIA and HP technologies were introduced into the workflow. “This is a massive computational challenge, and the HP and NVIDIA technologies have enabled us to do the first step: capture, check and store the 3D image data,” Fenton said. Using these technologies, the MBL researchers captured 10 terabytes of volumetric data and then performed human visual-quality inspections. Understanding Memory Could Prevent Neurological Diseases The team’s ultimate goal of discovering the function of memory at a molecular level can boost research into the root causes of brain diseases tied to neurocognition, such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. “People don’t normally think of memory as part of their mental health, but almost all mental dysfunction depends on what your brain stores — the beliefs, the anticipations, the anxieties that you have and the things that you expect,” said Fenton. “These are all different aspects of what happens when you have a memory, so almost all neuropsychiatric illnesses and manipulation depend on this understanding.” As a step toward solving these large-scale problems, the researchers are looking at how memory is affected when proteins go to incorrect locations in the hippocampus. The team is also examining the correlation between the structure and function of brain cells through high-resolution 3D images curated and stored using syGlass on the HP Z high performance workstation powered and supported with multiple NVIDIA RTX GPUs. “If we can understand how something is built, then if there’s a problem, we can dissect that and get to the bottom of it,” said Kumar. “That’s what we’re trying to do: understand how we retain memory, so if a problem arises, we know how to fix it.” Enabling Virtual Reality and Student Exploration The use of syGlass on the HP Z6 desktop workstation, running on NVIDIA RTX GPUs, turned the researchers’ endeavor from a time-consuming operation into an interactive scientific exploration — ideal for high-school-student engagement. “The HP-NVDIA-syGlass system lets us innovate by engaging three high-school interns,” said Kumar. “They had an abstract interest in our science, and we recognized that the syGlass virtual experience might enthrall them. We were right.” The researchers brought these three curious students into their lab this summer to analyze the memory proteins using the VR headsets, which allowed for 3D visuals of the data. Their task was to find the specific proteins that were memory-related and label them as such. While this may sound like a simple task, the interns had to sift through a sea of billions of neurons to find only a few thousand protein markers that were relevant to the research.

Due to the success of this pilot program, the team is now looking to expand high-school research opportunities for the project. “Why leave it at three students?” said Fenton. “Next year, it could be 10 at multiple locations helping us learn about brains while they learn about brains.” Learn more about NVIDIA-accelerated academic research .

      <title>Now Generally Available, NVIDIA RTX PRO 5000 72GB Blackwell GPU Expands Memory Options for Desktop Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-pro-5000-72gb-blackwell-gpu/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Top-notch options for AI at the desktops of developers, engineers and designers are expanding. The NVIDIA RTX PRO 5000 72GB Blackwell GPU is now generally available, bringing robust agentic and generative AI capabilities powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture to more desktops and professionals across the world. The new GPU configuration offers AI developers, data scientists and creative professionals the hardware for modern, memory-hungry workflows — and arrives at a time when demand for NVIDIA Blackwell-class compute is higher than ever. With the flexibility to choose between this 72GB variant and the existing NVIDIA RTX PRO 5000 48GB model, AI developers can right-size their systems for a wider range of budgets and project requirements. The NVIDIA RTX PRO 5000 Blackwell GPU. Fueling the Next Generation of AI Development As generative AI evolves into complex, multimodal agentic AI , more demand is placed on the hardware required to develop and deploy these technologies. One defining challenge of AI development is memory capacity. Running cutting-edge AI workflows — especially those involving large language models ( LLMs ) and AI agents — places significant stress on GPU memory, particularly as models, context windows and multimodal pipelines grow in size and complexity. Agentic AI systems involve chains of tools, retrieval-augmented generation ( RAG ), and multimodal understanding. These systems often need to keep multiple AI models, data sources and code formats active simultaneously within the GPU’s memory. Built on NVIDIA Blackwell — which delivers high throughput for AI, neural rendering and simulation with multi-workload scheduling and other architectural innovations — the RTX PRO 5000 72GB helps solve this bottleneck, offering 2,142 TOPS of AI performance. Plus, with 72GB of ultrafast GDDR7 memory — a 50% increase over the 48GB model — developers can train, fine-tune and prototype larger models locally. This enables users to maintain data privacy, low latency and cost efficiency, allowing teams to serve models directly from their workstations rather than relying on data-center-scale infrastructure for every AI task. Performance Enhancements For local AI development, raw compute is only half the battle — memory capacity determines what users can run, and throughput determines how fast it runs. In industry-standard benchmarks for generative AI, the RTX PRO 5000 72GB offers 3.5x the performance of prior-generation NVIDIA hardware for image generation, and 2x the performance of prior-generation hardware for text generation. In creative workflows, time saved in rendering is time gained for iteration.

      <title>UC San Diego Lab Advances Generative AI Research With NVIDIA DGX B200 System</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/ucsd-generative-ai-research-dgx-b200/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The Hao AI Lab research team at the University of California San Diego — at the forefront of pioneering AI model innovation — recently received an NVIDIA DGX B200 system to elevate their critical work in large language model inference . Many LLM inference platforms in production today, such as NVIDIA Dynamo , use research concepts that originated in the Hao AI Lab, including DistServe . How Is Hao AI Lab Using the DGX B200? Members of the Hao AI Lab standing with the NVIDIA DGX B200 system. With the DGX B200 now fully accessible to the Hao AI Lab and broader UC San Diego community at the School of Computing, Information and Data Sciences’ San Diego Supercomputer Center , the research opportunities are boundless. “DGX B200 is one of the most powerful AI systems from NVIDIA to date, which means that its performance is among the best in the world,” said Hao Zhang, assistant professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and department of computer science and engineering at UC San Diego. “It enables us to prototype and experiment much faster than using previous-generation hardware.” Two Hao AI Lab projects the DGX B200 is accelerating are FastVideo and the Lmgame benchmark. FastVideo focuses on training a family of video generation models to produce a five-second video based on a given text prompt — in just five seconds. The research phase of FastVideo taps into NVIDIA H200 GPUs in addition to the DGX B200 system. Lmgame-bench is a benchmarking suite that puts LLMs to the test using popular online games including Tetris and Super Mario Bros . Users can test one model at a time or put two models up against each other to measure their performance. The illustrated workflow of Hao AI Lab’s Lmgame-Bench project. Other ongoing projects at Hao AI Labs explore new ways to achieve low-latency LLM serving, pushing large language models toward real-time responsiveness. “Our current research uses the DGX B200 to explore the next frontier of low-latency LLM-serving on the awesome hardware specs the system gives us,” said Junda Chen, a doctoral candidate in computer science at UC San Diego. How DistServe Influenced Disaggregated Serving Disaggregated inference is a way to ensure large-scale LLM-serving engines can achieve the optimal aggregate system throughput while maintaining acceptably low latency for user requests. The benefit of disaggregated inference lies in optimizing what DistServe calls “goodput” instead of “throughput” in the LLM-serving engine. Here’s the difference: Throughput is measured by the number of tokens per second that the entire system can generate. Higher throughput means lower cost to generate each token to serve the user. For a long time, throughput was the only metric used by LLM-serving engines to measure their performance against one another. While throughput measures the aggregate performance of the system, it doesn’t directly correlate to the latency that a user perceives. If a user demands lower latency to generate the tokens, the system has to sacrifice throughput. This natural trade-off between throughput and latency is what led the DistServe team to propose a new metric, “goodput”: the measure of throughput while satisfying the user-specified latency objectives, usually called service-level objectives. In other words, goodput represents the overall health of a system while satisfying user experience. DistServe shows that goodput is a much better metric for LLM-serving systems, as it factors in both cost and service quality. Goodput leads to optimal efficiency and ideal output from a model. How Can Developers Achieve Optimal Goodput? When a user makes a request in an LLM system, the system takes the user input and generates the first token, known as prefill. Then, the system creates numerous output tokens, one after another, predicting each token’s future behavior based on past requests’ outcomes. This process is known as decode. https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/distserve.mp4 Prefill and decode have historically run on the same GPU, but the researchers behind DistServe found that splitting them onto different GPUs maximizes goodput. “Previously, if you put these two jobs on a GPU, they would compete with each other for resources, which could make it slow from a user perspective,” Chen said. “Now, if I split the jobs onto two different sets of GPUs — one doing prefill, which is compute intensive, and the other doing decode, which is more memory intensive — we can fundamentally eliminate the interference between the two jobs, making both jobs run faster. This process is called prefill/decode disaggregation, or separating the prefill from decode to get greater goodput. Increasing goodput and using the disaggregated inference method enables the continuous scaling of workloads without compromising on low-latency or high-quality model responses. NVIDIA Dynamo — an open-source framework designed to accelerate and scale generative AI models at the highest efficiency levels with the lowest cost — enables scaling disaggregated inference. In addition to these projects, cross-departmental collaborations, such as in healthcare and biology, are underway at UC San Diego to further optimize an array of research projects using the NVIDIA DGX B200, as researchers continue exploring how AI platforms can accelerate innovation.

      <title>How to Fine-Tune an LLM on NVIDIA GPUs With Unsloth</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-fine-tuning-unsloth-dgx-spark/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Modern workflows showcase the endless possibilities of generative and agentic AI on PCs. Of many, some examples include tuning a chatbot to handle product-support questions or building a personal assistant for managing one’s schedule. A challenge remains, however, in getting a small language model to respond consistently with high accuracy for specialized agentic tasks. That’s where fine-tuning comes in. Unsloth , one of the world’s most widely used open-source frameworks for fine-tuning LLMs, provides an approachable way to customize models. It’s optimized for efficient, low-memory training on NVIDIA GPUs — from GeForce RTX desktops and laptops to RTX PRO workstations and DGX Spark , the world’s smallest AI supercomputer. Another powerful starting point for fine-tuning is the just-announced NVIDIA Nemotron 3 family of open models, data and libraries. Nemotron 3 introduces the most efficient family of open models, ideal for agentic AI fine-tuning. Teaching AI New Tricks Fine-tuning is like giving an AI model a focused training session. With examples tied to a specific topic or workflow, the model improves its accuracy by learning new patterns and adapting to the task at hand. Choosing a fine-tuning method for a model depends on how much of the original model the developer wants to adjust. Based on their goals, developers can use one of three main fine-tuning methods: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (such as LoRA or QLoRA) : How it works: Updates only a small portion of the model for faster, lower-cost training. It’s a smarter and efficient way to enhance a model without altering it drastically. Target use case: Useful across nearly all scenarios where full fine-tuning would traditionally be applied — including adding domain knowledge, improving coding accuracy, adapting the model for legal or scientific tasks, refining reasoning, or aligning tone and behavior. Requirements: Small- to medium-sized dataset (100-1,000 prompt-sample pairs). Full fine-tuning : How it works: Updates all of the model’s parameters — useful for teaching the model to follow specific formats or styles. Target use case: Advanced use cases, such as building AI agents and chatbots that must provide assistance about a specific topic, stay within a certain set of guardrails and respond in a particular manner. Requirements: Large dataset (1,000+ prompt-sample pairs). Reinforcement learning : How it works: Adjusts the behavior of the model using feedback or preference signals. The model learns by interacting with its environment and uses the feedback to improve itself over time. This is a complex, advanced technique that interweaves training and inference — and can be used in tandem with parameter-efficient fine-tuning and full fine-tuning techniques. See Unsloth’s Reinforcement Learning Guide for details. Target use case: Improving the accuracy of a model in a particular domain — such as law or medicine — or building autonomous agents that can orchestrate actions on a user’s behalf. Requirements: A process that contains an action model, a reward model and an environment for the model to learn from. Another factor to consider is the VRAM required per each method. The chart below provides an overview of the requirements to run each type of fine-tuning method on Unsloth. Fine-tuning requirements on Unsloth. Unsloth: A Fast Path to Fine-Tuning on NVIDIA GPUs LLM fine-tuning is a memory- and compute-intensive workload that involves billions of matrix multiplications to update model weights at every training step. This type of heavy parallel workload requires the power of NVIDIA GPUs to complete the process quickly and efficiently. Unsloth shines at this workload, translating complex mathematical operations into efficient, custom GPU kernels to accelerate AI training. Unsloth helps boost the performance of the Hugging Face transformers library by 2.5x on NVIDIA GPUs. These GPU-specific optimizations, combined with Unsloth’s ease of use, make fine-tuning accessible to a broader community of AI enthusiasts and developers. The framework is built and optimized for NVIDIA hardware — from GeForce RTX laptops to RTX PRO workstations and DGX Spark — providing peak performance while reducing VRAM consumption. Unsloth provides helpful guides on how to get started and manage different LLM configurations, hyperparameters and options, along with example notebooks and step-by-step workflows.

Available Now: NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Family of Open Models The new Nemotron 3 family of open models — in Nano, Super, and Ultra sizes — built on a new hybrid latent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, introduces the most efficient family of open models with leading accuracy, ideal for building agentic AI applications. Nemotron 3 Nano 30B-A3B, available now, is the most compute-efficient model in the lineup. It’s optimized for tasks such as software debugging, content summarization, AI assistant workflows and information retrieval at low inference costs. Its hybrid MoE design delivers: Up to 60% fewer reasoning tokens, significantly reducing inference cost. A 1 million-token context window, allowing the model to retain far more information for long, multistep tasks. Nemotron 3 Super is a high-accuracy reasoning model for multi-agent applications, while Nemotron 3 Ultra is for complex AI applications. Both are expected to be available in the first half of 2026. NVIDIA also released today an open collection of training datasets and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning libraries. Nemotron 3 Nano fine-tuning is available on Unsloth. Download Nemotron 3 Nano now from Hugging Face , or experiment with it through Llama.cpp and LM Studio. DGX Spark: A Compact AI Powerhouse DGX Spark enables local fine-tuning and brings incredible AI performance in a compact, desktop supercomputer, giving developers access to more memory than a typical PC. Built on the NVIDIA Grace Blackwell architecture, DGX Spark delivers up to a petaflop of FP4 AI performance and includes 128GB of unified CPU-GPU memory, giving developers enough headroom to run larger models, longer context windows and more demanding training workloads locally. For fine-tuning, DGX Spark enables: Larger model sizes. Models with more than 30 billion parameters often exceed the VRAM capacity of consumer GPUs but fit comfortably within DGX Spark’s unified memory. More advanced techniques. Full fine-tuning and reinforcement-learning-based workflows — which demand more memory and higher throughput — run significantly faster on DGX Spark. Local control without cloud queues. Developers can run compute-heavy tasks locally instead of waiting for cloud instances or managing multiple environments. DGX Spark’s strengths go beyond LLMs. High-resolution diffusion models, for example, often require more memory than a typical desktop can provide. With FP4 support and large unified memory, DGX Spark can generate 1,000 images in just a few seconds and sustain higher throughput for creative or multimodal pipelines.
