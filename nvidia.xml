      <title>Mixture of Experts Powers the Most Intelligent Frontier AI Models, Runs 10x Faster on NVIDIA Blackwell NVL72</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/mixture-of-experts-frontier-models/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The top 10 most intelligent open-source models all use a mixture-of-experts architecture. Kimi K2 Thinking, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral Large 3 and others run 10x faster on NVIDIA GB200 NVL72. A look under the hood of virtually any frontier model today will reveal a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model architecture that mimics the efficiency of the human brain. Just as the brain activates specific regions based on the task, MoE models divide work among specialized “experts,” activating only the relevant ones for every AI token . This results in faster, more efficient token generation without a proportional increase in compute. The industry has already recognized this advantage. On the independent Artificial Analysis (AA) leaderboard , the top 10 most intelligent open-source models use an MoE architecture, including DeepSeek AI’s DeepSeek-R1, Moonshot AI’s Kimi K2 Thinking, OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120B and Mistral AI’s Mistral Large 3. However, scaling MoE models in production while delivering high performance is notoriously difficult. The extreme codesign of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems combines hardware and software optimizations for maximum performance and efficiency, making it practical and straightforward to scale MoE models. The Kimi K2 Thinking MoE model — ranked as the most intelligent open-source model on the AA leaderboard — sees a 10x performance leap on the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system compared with NVIDIA HGX H200. Building on the performance delivered for the DeepSeek-R1 and Mistral Large 3 MoE models, this breakthrough underscores how MoE is becoming the architecture of choice for frontier models — and why NVIDIA’s full-stack inference platform is the key to unlocking its full potential. What Is MoE, and Why Has It Become the Standard for Frontier Models? Until recently, the industry standard for building smarter AI was simply building bigger, dense models that use all of their model parameters — often hundreds of billions for today’s most capable models — to generate every token. While powerful, this approach requires immense computing power and energy, making it challenging to scale. Much like the human brain relies on specific regions to handle different cognitive tasks — whether processing language, recognizing objects or solving a math problem — MoE models comprise several specialized “experts.” For any given token, only the most relevant ones are activated by a router. This design means that even though the overall model may contain hundreds of billions of parameters, generating a token involves using only a small subset — often just tens of billions. Like the human brain uses specific regions for different tasks, mixture-of-experts models use a router to select only the most relevant experts to generate every token. By selectively engaging only the experts that matter most, MoE models achieve higher intelligence and adaptability without a matching rise in computational cost. This makes them the foundation for efficient AI systems optimized for performance per dollar and per watt — generating significantly more intelligence for every unit of energy and capital invested. Given these advantages, it is no surprise that MoE has rapidly become the architecture of choice for frontier models, adopted by over 60% of open-source AI model releases this year. Since early 2023, it’s enabled a nearly 70x increase in model intelligence — pushing the limits of AI capability. Since early 2025, nearly all leading frontier models use MoE designs. “Our pioneering work with OSS mixture-of-experts architecture, starting with Mixtral 8x7B two years ago, ensures advanced intelligence is both accessible and sustainable for a broad range of applications,” said Guillaume Lample, cofounder and chief scientist at Mistral AI. “Mistral Large 3’s MoE architecture enables us to scale AI systems to greater performance and efficiency while dramatically lowering energy and compute demands.” Overcoming MoE Scaling Bottlenecks With Extreme Codesign Frontier MoE models are simply too large and complex to be deployed on a single GPU. To run them, experts must be distributed across multiple GPUs, a technique called expert parallelism. Even on powerful platforms such as the NVIDIA H200, deploying MoE models involves bottlenecks such as: Memory limitations : For each token, GPUs must dynamically load the selected experts’ parameters from high-bandwidth memory, causing frequent heavy pressure on memory bandwidth. Latency : Experts must execute a near-instantaneous all-to-all communication pattern to exchange information and form a final, complete answer. However, on H200, spreading experts across more than eight GPUs requires them to communicate over higher-latency scale-out networking, limiting the benefits of expert parallelism. The solution: extreme codesign. NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 is a rack-scale system with 72 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs working together as if they were one, delivering 1.4 exaflops of AI performance and 30TB of fast shared memory. The 72 GPUs are connected using NVLink Switch into a single, massive NVLink interconnect fabric, which allows every GPU to communicate with each other with 130 TB/s of NVLink connectivity. MoE models can tap into this design to scale expert parallelism far beyond previous limits — distributing the experts across a much larger set of up to 72 GPUs. This architectural approach directly resolves MoE scaling bottlenecks by: Reducing the number of experts per GPU : Distributing experts across up to 72 GPUs reduces the number of experts per GPU, minimizing parameter-loading pressure on each GPU’s high-bandwidth memory. Fewer experts per GPU also frees up memory space, allowing each GPU to serve more concurrent users and support longer input lengths. Accelerating expert communication : Experts spread across GPUs can communicate with each other instantly using NVLink. The NVLink Switch also has the compute power needed to perform some of the calculations required to combine information from various experts, speeding up delivery of the final answer. Other full-stack optimizations also play a key role in unlocking high inference performance for MoE models. The NVIDIA Dynamo framework orchestrates disaggregated serving by assigning prefill and decode tasks to different GPUs, allowing decode to run with large expert parallelism, while prefill uses parallelism techniques better suited to its workload. The NVFP4 format helps maintain accuracy while further boosting performance and efficiency. Open-source inference frameworks such as NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, SGLang and vLLM support these optimizations for MoE models. SGLang, in particular, has played a significant role in advancing large-scale MoE on GB200 NVL72 , helping validate and mature many of the techniques used today. To bring this performance to enterprises worldwide, the GB200 NVL72 is being deployed by major cloud service providers and NVIDIA Cloud Partners including Amazon Web Services, Core42, CoreWeave, Crusoe, Google Cloud, Lambda, Microsoft Azure, Nebius, Nscale, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Together AI and others. “At CoreWeave, our customers are leveraging our platform to put mixture-of-experts models into production as they build agentic workflows,” said Peter Salanki, cofounder and chief technology officer at CoreWeave. “By working closely with NVIDIA, we are able to deliver a tightly integrated platform that brings MoE performance, scalability and reliability together in one place. You can only do that on a cloud purpose-built for AI.” Customers such as DeepL are using Blackwell NVL72 rack-scale design to build and deploy their next-generation AI models. “DeepL is leveraging NVIDIA GB200 hardware to train mixture-of-experts models, advancing its model architecture to improve efficiency during training and inference, setting new benchmarks for performance in AI,” said Paul Busch, research team lead at DeepL. The Proof Is in the Performance Per Watt NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 efficiently scales complex MoE models and delivers a 10x leap in performance per watt. This performance leap isn’t just a benchmark; it enables 10x the token revenue, transforming the economics of AI at scale in power- and cost-constrained data centers. At NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C., NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang highlighted how GB200 NVL72 delivers 10x the performance of NVIDIA Hopper for DeepSeek-R1, and this performance extends to other DeepSeek variants as well. “With GB200 NVL72 and Together AI’s custom optimizations, we are exceeding customer expectations for large-scale inference workloads for MoE models like DeepSeek-V3,” said Vipul Ved Prakash, cofounder and CEO of Together AI. “The performance gains come from NVIDIA’s full-stack optimizations coupled with Together AI Inference breakthroughs across kernels, runtime engine and speculative decoding.” This performance advantage is evident across other frontier models. Kimi K2 Thinking, the most intelligent open-source model, serves as another proof point, achieving 10x better generational performance when deployed on GB200 NVL72. Fireworks AI has currently deployed Kimi K2 on the NVIDIA B200 platform to achieve the highest performance on the Artificial Analysis leaderboard . “NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale design makes MoE model serving dramatically more efficient,” said Lin Qiao, cofounder and CEO of Fireworks AI. “Looking ahead, NVL72 has the potential to transform how we serve massive MoE models, delivering major performance improvements over the Hopper platform and setting a new bar for frontier model speed and efficiency.” Mistral Large 3 also achieved a 10x performance gain on the GB200 NVL72 compared with the prior-generation H200. This generational gain translates into better user experience, lower per-token cost and higher energy efficiency for this new MoE model. Powering Intelligence at Scale The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 rack-scale system is designed to deliver strong performance beyond MoE models. The reason becomes clear when taking a look at where AI is heading: the newest generation of multimodal AI models have specialized components for language, vision, audio and other modalities, activating only the ones relevant to the task at hand. In agentic systems, different “agents” specialize in planning, perception, reasoning, tool use or search, and an orchestrator coordinates them to deliver a single outcome. In both cases, the core pattern mirrors MoE: route each part of the problem to the most relevant experts, then coordinate their outputs to produce the final outcome. Extending this principle to production environments where multiple applications and agents serve multiple users unlocks new levels of efficiency. Instead of duplicating massive AI models for every agent or application, this approach can enable a shared pool of experts accessible to all, with each request routed to the right expert. Mixture of experts is a powerful architecture moving the industry toward a future where massive capability, efficiency and scale coexist. The GB200 NVL72 unlocks this potential today, and NVIDIA’s roadmap with the NVIDIA Vera Rubin architecture will continue to expand the horizons of frontier models.

      <title>At NeurIPS, NVIDIA Advances Open Model Development for Digital and Physical AI</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/neurips-open-source-digital-physical-ai/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Researchers worldwide rely on open-source technologies as the foundation of their work. To equip the community with the latest advancements in digital and physical AI, NVIDIA is further expanding its collection of open AI models, datasets and tools — with potential applications in virtually every research field. At NeurIPS , one of the world’s top AI conferences, NVIDIA is unveiling open physical AI models and tools to support research, including Alpamayo-R1, the world’s first industry-scale open reasoning vision language action (VLA) model for autonomous driving. In digital AI, NVIDIA is releasing new models and datasets for speech and AI safety. NVIDIA researchers are presenting over 70 papers, talks and workshops at the conference, sharing innovative projects that span AI reasoning, medical research, autonomous vehicle (AV) development and more. These initiatives deepen NVIDIA’s commitment to open source — an effort recognized by a new Openness Index from Artificial Analysis , an independent organization that benchmarks AI. The Artificial Analysis Open Index rates the NVIDIA Nemotron family of open technologies for frontier AI development among the most open in the AI ecosystem based on the permissibility of the model licenses, data transparency and availability of technical details. NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo-R1 Opens New Research Frontier for Autonomous Driving NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo-R1 (AR1) , the world’s first open reasoning VLA model for AV research, integrates chain-of-thought AI reasoning with path planning — a component critical for advancing AV safety in complex road scenarios and enabling level 4 autonomy . While previous iterations of self-driving models struggled with nuanced situations — a pedestrian-heavy intersection, an upcoming lane closure or a double-parked vehicle in a bike lane — reasoning gives autonomous vehicles the common sense to drive more like humans do. AR1 accomplishes this by breaking down a scenario and reasoning through each step. It considers all possible trajectories, then uses contextual data to choose the best route. For example, by tapping into the chain-of-thought reasoning enabled by AR1, an AV driving in a pedestrian-heavy area next to a bike lane could take in data from its path, incorporate reasoning traces — explanations on why it took certain actions — and use that information to plan its future trajectory, such as moving away from the bike lane or stopping for potential jaywalkers. https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/construction_worker.mp4 AR1’s open foundation, based on NVIDIA Cosmos Reason , lets researchers customize the model for their own non-commercial use cases, whether for benchmarking or building experimental AV applications. For post-training AR1, reinforcement learning has proven especially effective — researchers observed a significant improvement in reasoning capabilities with AR1 compared with the pretrained model. NVIDIA DRIVE Alpamayo-R1 is now available on GitHub and Hugging Face , and a subset of the data used to train and evaluate the model is available in the NVIDIA Physical AI Open Datasets . NVIDIA has also released the open-source AlpaSim framework to evaluate AR1. Learn more about reasoning VLA models for autonomous driving . Customizing NVIDIA Cosmos for Any Physical AI Use Case Developers can learn how to use and post-train Cosmos-based models using step-by-step recipes, quick-start inference examples and advanced post-training workflows now available in the Cosmos Cookbook . It’s a comprehensive guide for physical AI developers that covers every step in AI development, including data curation, synthetic data generation and model evaluation. There are virtually limitless possibilities for Cosmos-based applications. The latest examples from NVIDIA include: LidarGen , the first world model that can generate lidar data for AV simulation. Omniverse NuRec Fixer , a model for AV and robotics simulation that taps into NVIDIA Cosmos Predict to near-instantly address artifacts in neurally reconstructed data, such as blurs and holes from novel views or noisy data. Cosmos Policy , a framework for turning large pretrained video models into robust robot policies — a set of rules that dictate a robot’s behavior. ProtoMotions3 , an open-source, GPU-accelerated framework built on NVIDIA Newton and Isaac Lab for training physically simulated digital humans and humanoid robots with realistic scenes generated by Cosmos world foundation models (WFMs) . Sample outputs from the LidarGen model, built on Cosmos. The top row shows the input data with generated lidar data overlaid. The middle row shows generated and real lidar range maps. Bottom left shows the real lidar point cloud, while bottom right shows the point cloud generated by LidarGen. Policy models can be trained in NVIDIA Isaac Lab and Isaac Sim , and data generated from the policy models can then be used to post-train NVIDIA GR00T N models for robotics. Humanoid policy trained with ProtoMotions3 in Isaac Sim, with 3D background scene generated by Lyra with Cosmos WFM. NVIDIA ecosystem partners are developing their latest technologies with Cosmos WFMs. AV developer Voxel51 is contributing model recipes to the Cosmos Cookbook. Physical AI developers 1X , Figure AI, Foretellix, Gatik, Oxa, PlusAI and X-Humanoid are using WFMs for their latest physical AI applications. And researchers at ETH Zurich are presenting a NeurIPS paper that highlights using Cosmos models for realistic and cohesive 3D scene creation. NVIDIA Nemotron Additions Bolster the Digital AI Developer Toolkit NVIDIA is also releasing new multi-speaker speech AI models, a new model with reasoning capabilities and datasets for AI safety, as well as open tools to generate high-quality synthetic datasets for reinforcement learning and domain-specific model customization. These tools include: MultiTalker Parakeet : An automatic speech recognition model for streaming audio that can understand multiple speakers, even in overlapped or fast-paced conversations. Sortformer : A state-of-the-art model that can accurately distinguish multiple speakers within an audio stream — a process called diarization — in real time. Nemotron Content Safety Reasoning : A reasoning-based AI safety model that dynamically enforces custom policies across domains. Nemotron Content Safety Audio Dataset : A synthetic dataset that helps train models to detect unsafe audio content, enabling the development of guardrails that work across text and audio modalities. NeMo Gym : an open-source library that accelerates and simplifies the development of reinforcement learning environments for LLM training. NeMo Gym also contains a growing collection of ready-to-use training environments to enable Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR). NeMo Data Designer Library : Now open-sourced under Apache 2.0, this library provides an end-to-end toolkit to generate, validate and refine high-quality synthetic datasets for generative AI development, including domain-specific model customization and evaluation. NVIDIA ecosystem partners using NVIDIA Nemotron and NeMo tools to build secure, specialized agentic AI include CrowdStrike, Palantir and ServiceNow. NeurIPS attendees can explore these innovations at the Nemotron Summit , taking place today, from 4-8 p.m. PT, with an opening address by Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at NVIDIA. NVIDIA Research Furthers Language AI Innovation Of the dozens of NVIDIA-authored research papers at NeurIPS , here are a few highlights advancing language models: Audio Flamingo 3: Advancing Audio Intelligence With Fully Open Large Audio Language Models : This large audio language model is capable of reasoning across speech, sound and music. It can understand and reason audio segments up to 10 minutes in length, achieving state-of-the-art results on over 20 benchmarks. Minitron-SSM: Efficient Hybrid Language Model Compression Through Group-Aware SSM Pruning : This poster introduces a pruning method capable of compressing hybrid models, demonstrated by pruning and distilling Nemotron-H 8B from 8 billion to 4 billion parameters. The resulting model surpasses the accuracy of similarly sized models while achieving 2x faster inference throughput. Jet-Nemotron: Efficient Language Model With Post Neural Architecture Search : This work presents a cost-efficient post-training pipeline for developing new efficient language model architectures, and introduces a hybrid-architecture model family produced with the pipeline. These models match or surpass the accuracy of leading full-attention baselines while delivering substantially higher generation throughput. Nemotron-Flash: Towards Latency-Optimal Hybrid Small Language Models : This project introduces a new small language model (SLM) architecture that redesigns SLMs around real-world latency rather than parameter count — achieving state-of-the-art speed and accuracy. ProRL: Prolonged Reinforcement Learning Expands Reasoning Boundaries in Large Language Models : Prolonged reinforcement learning, or ProRL, is a technique that extends model training over longer periods. In this NeurIPS poster, NVIDIA researchers describe how this methodology results in models that consistently outperform base models for reasoning.

      <title>FLUX.2 Image Generation Models Now Released, Optimized for NVIDIA RTX GPUs</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/rtx-ai-garage-flux-2-comfyui/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Black Forest Labs — the frontier AI research lab developing visual generative AI models — today released the FLUX.2 family of state-of-the-art image generation models. FLUX.2 is packed with new tools and capabilities, including a multi-reference feature that can generate dozens of similar image variations, in photorealistic detail and with cleaner fonts — even at scale. NVIDIA has worked with Black Forest Labs and ComfyUI to make the models available with FP8 quantizations and RTX GPU performance optimizations at launch, decreasing the VRAM required to run them by 40% and improving performance by 40%. Requiring no special software package to run, the models are available directly in ComfyUI . State-of-the-Art Visual Intelligence Images generated by FLUX.2 are photorealistic, even at scale, featuring up to 4 megapixel resolution with real-world lighting and physics to eliminate that “AI look” that undermines visual fidelity. The models add direct pose control to explicitly specify the pose of a subject or character in an image, as well as deliver clean, readable text across infographics, user interface screens and even multilingual content. Plus, the new multi-reference feature enables artists to select up to six reference images where the style or subject stays consistent — eliminating the need for extensive model fine-tuning. Stunning, photorealistic details. Image courtesy of Black Forest Labs. For a complete overview of new FLUX.2 features, read Black Forest Labs’ blog . Optimized for RTX The new FLUX.2 models are impressive, but also quite demanding. They run a staggering 32-billion-parameter model requiring 90GB VRAM to load completely. Even using lowVRAM mode — a popular setting that allows artists to only load the active model at a time — the VRAM requirement is still 64GB, which puts the model virtually out of reach for any consumer card to use effectively. To broaden FLUX.2 model accessibility, NVIDIA and Black Forest Labs collaborated to quantize the model to FP8 — reducing the VRAM requirements by 40% at comparable quality. FLUX.2 is here. And to make this model accessible on GeForce RTX GPUs, NVIDIA has partnered with ComfyUI — a popular application to run visual generative AI models on PC — to improve the app’s RAM offload feature, known as weight streaming. Using the upgraded feature, users can offload parts of the model to system memory, extending the available memory on their GPUs — albeit with some performance loss, as system memory is slower than GPU memory. NVIDIA has also been collaborating with ComfyUI to optimize model performance on NVIDIA and GeForce RTX GPUs, including optimizations for FP8 checkpoints. Get started with FLUX.2 today. Update ComfyUI and check out the FLUX.2 templates, or visit Black Forest Labs’ Hugging Face page to download the model weights.

      <title>Into the Omniverse: How Smart City AI Agents Transform Urban Operations</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/smart-city-ai-agents-urban-operations/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Editor’s note: This post is part of Into the Omniverse , a series focused on how developers, 3D practitioners and enterprises can transform their workflows using the latest advancements in OpenUSD and NVIDIA Omniverse . Cities worldwide face unprecedented challenges as urban populations surge and infrastructure strains to keep pace. Operational challenges like traffic congestion and coordinating emergency services are compounded by fragmented data pipelines, siloed local government processes and disparate systems. Technical barriers prevent cities from accessing the comprehensive, real-time insights needed for effective decision-making and city management. Leading cities and technology partners are deploying the NVIDIA Blueprint for smart city AI , a reference application that provides the complete software stack to build, test and operate AI agents in simulation-ready ( SimReady ) digital twins. OpenUSD is an open and extensible framework that connects to each stage of this physical AI workflow. OpenUSD-enabled digital twins serve as SimReady environments where cities can simulate “what if” scenarios and generate physically accurate sensor data. The blueprint powers a three-stage workflow: 1) simulate with the NVIDIA Cosmos platform and NVIDIA Omniverse libraries to generate synthetic data, 2) train and fine-tune vision AI models, and 3) deploy real-time video analytics AI agents with the NVIDIA Metropolis platform and the NVIDIA Blueprint for video search and summarization (VSS). This enables cities to move from reactive to proactive operations.​ Based on these simulations, cities can deploy operational platforms where weather data, traffic sensors and emergency response systems converge, supporting rapid testing of rare scenarios, real-time monitoring, city infrastructure planning and optimization of urban systems. From Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, cutting incident response times by 80% with street-level AI to Raleigh, North Carolina, achieving 95% vehicle detection accuracy and French rail networks optimizing energy consumption by 20%, cities across the globe are using digital twins and AI agents to transform urban operations at scale. Smart Cities in Action Akila, With SNCF Gares&Connexions, Uses Digital Twins to Improve Rail Operations Akila’s digital twin application helps French rail operator SNCF Gares&Connexions optimize its network of nearly 14,000 daily trains with live scenario planning for solar heating, air flow and crowd movement. The OpenUSD-enabled digital twins deliver a 20% reduction in energy consumption, 100% on-time preventive maintenance and a 50% reduction in downtime and response times. Linker Vision Taps Physical AI for Street-Level Intelligence Linker Vision’s physical AI system recognizes infrastructure events in Kaohsiung City, including damaged streetlights and fallen trees, eliminating manual city inspections and enabling faster emergency response. To scale its street-level intelligence to more cities, Linker Vision uses Omniverse libraries for simulation, Cosmos Reason for world understanding and the VSS blueprint for deployment powered by OpenUSD. Esri and Microsoft Enable Comprehensive Urban Intelligence in the City of Raleigh The City of Raleigh achieved 95% vehicle detection accuracy using the NVIDIA DeepStream software development kit, boosting traffic analysis workflows for engineers. This data enhances Raleigh’s digital twin, enabled by Esri’s ArcGIS geospatial platform to support visualization and analysis for critical infrastructure planning and management. Integrating this computer vision pipeline with a vision AI agent powered by the NVIDIA VSS blueprint provides comprehensive real-time visibility and insights in ArcGIS on Azure Cloud. Milestone Systems’ VLM Automates Video Review Milestone Systems is soon launching its Hafnia VLM, which will include a VLM plug-in for its video management software XProtect as well as a VLM-as-a-service. Fine-tuned on more than 75,000 hours of video data, the Hafnia VLM can reduce operator alarm fatigue by up to 30% by automating video review and filtering out false alarms. It was developed with NVIDIA Cosmos Reason VLMs and Metropolis. The Hafnia VLM plug-in for XProtect will make generative AI more easily accessible for XProtect operators and users. K2K Analyzes Italy Video Streams K2K’s platform uses NVIDIA Cosmos Reason and the VSS blueprint to analyze over 1,000 video streams in Palermo, Italy, processing 7 billion events annually and automatically notifying city officials through natural language queries and video events when critical conditions are extracted and analyzed.

      <title>The Largest Digital Zoo: Biology Model Trained on NVIDIA GPUs Identifies Over a Million Species</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/bioclip2-foundation-ai-model/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Tanya Berger-Wolf’s first computational biology project started as a bet with a colleague: that she could build an AI model capable of identifying individual zebras faster than a zoologist. She won. Now, the director of the Translational Data Analytics Institute and a professor at The Ohio State University, Berger-Wolf is taking on the whole animal kingdom with BioCLIP 2 , a biology-based foundation model trained on the biggest, most diverse dataset of organisms to date. The model will be showcased at this year’s NeurIPS AI research conference. BioCLIP 2 goes beyond extracting information from images. It can distinguish species’ traits and determine inter-and intraspecies relationships. For example, the model arranged Darwin’s finches by beak size, without teaching the concept of size, shown in the image below. Scatter plot shows how BioCLIP 2 arranges Darwin’s finches by beak size from left to right. These capabilities will allow researchers to use the model as both a biological encyclopedia, a powerful scientific platform and an interactive research tool with inference capabilities to help address an ongoing issue in conservation biology: data deficiency for certain species. “For iconic species like killer whales, we lack enough data to determine population size and for polar bears, the population is unknown,” said Berger-Wolf. “If we don’t have data for those species, what hope do the beetles and fungi have?” AI models can enhance existing conservation efforts for threatened species and their habitats by filling this data-deficiency gap. BioCLIP 2 is available under an open-source license on Hugging Face , where it was downloaded over 45,000 times last month. This paper builds on the first BioCLIP model, released over a year ago, which was also trained on NVIDIA GPUs and received the Best Student Paper award at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) conference. The BioCLIP 2 paper will be presented at NeurIPS, taking place Nov. 30-Dec. 5 in Mexico City, and Dec. 2-7 in San Diego. Building the World’s Biggest Biological Flash Card Deck The project began with the compilation of a massive dataset, TREEOFLIFE-200M , which comprises 214 million images of organisms that span over 925,000 taxonomic classes — from monkeys to mealworms and magnolias. To curate this vast amount of data, Berger-Wolf’s team at the Imageomics Institute collaborated with the Smithsonian Institution , experts from various universities and other field-related organizations. These researchers set out to discover what would happen if they trained a biology model on more data than ever. The team wanted to see if it was possible to move “beyond the science of individual organisms to the science of ecosystems,” said Berger-Wolf. After 10 days of training on 32 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, BioCLIP 2 displayed novel abilities, such as distinguishing between adult and juvenile as well as male and female animals within species — without being explicitly taught these concepts. It also made associations between related species — like understanding how zebras relate to other equids. “This model learns that at every level of taxonomy, all of these images of zebras have a particular genus label, and of these images of equids — including zebras, horses and donkeys — they have a particular family trait and so on,” she said. “It learns the hierarchy without ever being told it, just through these associations.” The model can even determine the health of an organism based on training data. For example, it separated healthy apple or blueberry leaves from diseased leaves, as well as could recognize differing types of diseases, when generating the scatter plot below. The scatter plots show plant species better separated as the model is trained. The intra-species variations also form clusters, making them easier to separate. Berger-Wolf’s team used a cluster of 64 NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs to accelerate model training, plus individual Tensor Core GPUs for inference . “Foundation models like BioCLIP would not be possible without NVIDIA accelerated computing,” said Berger-Wolf. Wildlife Digital Twins: The Future of Studying Ecosystem Relationships The researchers’ next endeavor is to develop a wildlife-based interactive digital twin that can be used to visualize and simulate ecological interactions between species as well as their ways of engaging with the environment. The goal is to provide a safe, easy way to study organismal relationships that naturally occur in the wild, while minimizing impact and disturbance on ecosystems. “The digital twin allows us to visualize species interactions and put them in context, as well as to play the what-if scenarios and test our models without destroying the actual environment — creating as light a footprint as possible,” said Berger-Wolf. The digital twin will give scientists the opportunity to explore the points of view of the species they’re studying within the simulated environment, opening endless possibilities for more complex and accurate ecological research. Eventually, versions of this technology could even be deployed for public use — such as through interactive platforms at zoos. People could explore, visualize and learn about the natural environment and its many species from entirely new vantage points. “I’m getting goosebumps just imagining that scenario of a kid coming into the zoo and being like, wow — this is what you would see if you were another zebra part of that herd, or if you were the little spider sitting on that scratching post,” Berger-Wolf said.

      <title>Powering AI Superfactories, NVIDIA and Microsoft Integrate Latest Technologies for Inference, Cybersecurity, Physical AI</title>
      <link>https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-microsoft-ai-superfactories/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Timed with the Microsoft Ignite conference running this week, NVIDIA is expanding its collaboration with Microsoft, including through the adoption of next-generation NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet switches for the new Microsoft Fairwater AI superfactory, powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell platform. The collaboration brings new integrations across Microsoft 365 Copilot, as well as the public preview of next-generation Azure NC Series VMs powered by NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPUs , NVIDIA Nemotron integrations to accelerate AI for Microsoft SQL Server 2025, capabilities for onboarding AI agents in Microsoft 365 and optimizations for high-performance inference, cybersecurity and physical AI. Microsoft’s AI Superfactory connects the landmark Fairwater data center in Wisconsin with a new, state-of-the-art facility in Atlanta , Georgia. This massive-scale infrastructure will integrate hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs for large-scale training. In addition, Microsoft is deploying more than 100,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs in NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 systems being deployed globally for inference. “Our collaboration with NVIDIA is built on driving innovation across the entire system and full stack, from silicon to services,” said Nidhi Chappell, corporate vice president of product management at Microsoft. “By coupling Microsoft Azure’s unmatched data center scale with NVIDIA’s accelerated computing, we are maximizing AI data center performance and efficiency, which is of paramount importance for our customers leading the new AI era.” The most demanding workloads for OpenAI, the Microsoft AI Superintelligence Team, Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Foundry services will be powered by this infrastructure. Customers like Black Forest Labs are also using NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems to train next-generation multimodal FLUX models that power visual intelligence. To connect this massive infrastructure, Microsoft is deploying next-generation NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet switches in its Fairwater AI data center — the largest and most sophisticated AI factories ever built — delivering the performance, scale and efficiency required for OpenAI to run large-scale AI models and applications. New Azure NCv6 Series VMs with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs are now in public preview on Azure, expanding the Blackwell platform to provide right-sized acceleration for multiple workloads including multimodal agentic AI, industrial digitalization with NVIDIA Omniverse libraries, scientific simulation and visual computing. This flexibility extends from the cloud to the edge with Azure Local , enabling powerful sovereign AI solutions while bringing low-latency, real-time AI to wherever data needs to reside. This allows enterprises to seamlessly develop, deploy and manage AI-powered digital twins and generative AI applications with NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs from the Azure cloud directly to their factory floors, on-premises data centers or secure edge locations. Software Optimizations Deliver a Fungible AI Fleet The NVIDIA platform on Azure, spanning NVIDIA Blackwell and Hopper GPUs, accelerates the latest models from the Microsoft AI Superintelligence Team, including text (MAI-1-preview), real-time voice (MAI-Voice-1) and high-fidelity image generation (MAI-Image-1) — bringing new multimodal experiences across Bing Image Creator and Microsoft Copilot. Central to NVIDIA’s collaboration with Microsoft is building a fungible fleet — a flexible, continuously modernized infrastructure that can accelerate any workload with maximum efficiency. This is achieved through continuous, full-stack software optimizations that deliver compounding performance gains and maximize throughput across the entire AI lifecycle and across multiple NVIDIA architectures on Azure. The gains also extend to workloads beyond generative AI, including data processing, vector search, databases, digital twins, scientific computing and 3D design. This co-engineering saves significant costs for customers, making AI projects that were once theoretical now economically viable. For example, the continuous full-stack optimization work has directly contributed to an over 90% drop in the price of popular GPT models for end users on Azure in two years. Ongoing optimization work now extends to Microsoft Foundry , where the NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library helps boost throughput, reduce latency and lower costs for a wide range of popular open models. NVIDIA and Microsoft have also partnered to optimize their fleet for AI workload performance through the NVIDIA DGX Cloud Benchmarking suite. Engineering teams from both companies worked closely together to identify bottlenecks and implement infrastructure tuning, driving performance gains. By achieving 95% of the performance possible using the NVIDIA reference architecture, Microsoft was named an Exemplar Cloud for H100 training. From Intelligent Data to AI Agents NVIDIA and Microsoft are integrating AI into the core of the enterprise, unlocking decades of proprietary data stored in one of the world’s most trusted databases. NVIDIA is accelerating AI in the new Microsoft SQL Server 2025 by integrating it with NVIDIA Nemotron open models and NVIDIA NIM microservices. This solution delivers GPU-optimized, secure and scalable retrieval-augmented generation directly where enterprise data lives, in the cloud or on premises. Plus, the collaboration extends to the new frontier of agentic AI in the workplace. The NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit now connects with Microsoft Agent 365 , enabling developers to build, deploy and onboard compliant, enterprise-ready AI agents directly into the Microsoft 365 app ecosystem, including Outlook, Teams, Word and SharePoint. To power these new enterprise agents, Microsoft Foundry now offers NVIDIA Nemotron models for digital AI and NVIDIA Cosmos models for physical AI as secure NIM microservices. Developers can use them to build enterprise-grade agentic AI for a vast range of applications that benefit from multimodal intelligence, multilingual reasoning, math, coding and physical AI capabilities. The collaboration is also tackling cyber threats for enterprises. Microsoft and NVIDIA are collaborating on research for new adversarial learning models , built on the NVIDIA Dynamo-Triton framework and the NVIDIA TensorRT suite of tools, that can help enterprises defend against real-time cybersecurity threats with a 160x performance speedup compared with CPU methods. Physical AI and Industrial Digitalization NVIDIA and Microsoft are building the future of physical AI . With NVIDIA Omniverse libraries available on Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA is unlocking end-to-end reindustrialization in the cloud through its developer ecosystem. Developers are transforming industrial workflows, from computer-aided engineering with Synopsys to factory operations with Sight Machine and SymphonyAI . Robotics developers can tap into the NVIDIA Isaac Sim open-source robotics simulation framework to unlock critical workflows, from synthetic data generation to software-in-the-loop testing for all types of robot embodiments. Hexagon is building its AEON humanoid robot primarily using NVIDIA’s full robotics stack on Azure. Similarly, the robotics platform, Wandelbots NOVA , running on Azure integrates Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab to simplify and speed up simulation to real-world deployment. In addition, NVIDIA and Microsoft are using a standardized approach for digital engineering to enable seamless OpenUSD interoperability across 3D workflows, making simulation and digital content creation accessible in the cloud. This expanded collaboration comes on the heels of a partnership announced with Anthropic and Microsoft earlier today. NVIDIA and Anthropic will collaborate on design and engineering to optimize Anthropic models for performance, efficiency and total cost of ownership, as well as optimize future NVIDIA architectures for Anthropic workloads.
