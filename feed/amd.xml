NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This press release contains forward-looking non-GAAP measures concerning AMD’s long-term financial model such as operating margin and earnings per share. These forward-looking non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations, assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook and long-term financial model typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, income tax provision, and other non-recurring items such as impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. A reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time as the timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control. Such events may include unanticipated changes in AMD’s effective tax rate, unanticipated one-time charges related to asset impairments, unanticipated acquisition-related expenses, unanticipated gains, losses, and impairments, and other unanticipated non-recurring items not reflective of ongoing operations. All statements made in this press release are based on current expectations as of November 11, 2025, and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements made in this press release except as may be required by law.
